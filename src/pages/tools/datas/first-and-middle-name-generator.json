      "question": "How does the generator work?",
      "answer": "Our generator uses a sophisticated (okay, maybe not *that* sophisticated) algorithm to combine a curated list of first and middle names. We've hand-picked a diverse selection to ensure you get a wide range of suggestions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names generated random?",
      "answer": "While the combinations are random, the names themselves are carefully chosen for their popularity, uniqueness, and overall awesomeness. We avoid anything *too* out there (unless that's your thing!)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use the generated names for commercial purposes?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Once the generator suggests the name, it\u2019s yours to use for books, games, businesses, or anything you can dream up. Just remember, we're not responsible for any sudden fame or fortune that might come your way."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there a limit to how many names I can generate?",
      "answer": "Nope! Generate as many names as your heart desires. We're here to fuel your creativity, not limit it. Go wild!"

      "question": "Can I submit names to be added to the generator?",
      "answer": "We're always open to suggestions! While we can't guarantee every submission will be added, we appreciate your input. Send us your name ideas and we'll take a look!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the generated names culturally sensitive?",
      "answer": "We strive to include a diverse range of names, but we encourage you to research the cultural significance and appropriateness of any name before using it, especially if you're not familiar with its origin."
