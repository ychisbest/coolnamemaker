      "question": "What exactly *is* a Qunari?",
      "answer": "Qunari are a race of imposing humanoids in the Dragon Age universe, known for their strict societal structure (the Qun) and formidable fighting prowess. Think disciplined warriors with horns. Pretty cool, right?"

    {
      "question": "How are Qunari names typically structured?",
