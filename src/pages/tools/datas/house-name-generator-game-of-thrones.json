  "slug": "house-name-generator-game-of-thrones",
  "icon": "\ud83c\udff0",
  "introduction": "Winter is coming... and so is the perfect name for your Game of Thrones House! Tired of the same old 'Stark' and 'Lannister'? Want a name that screams power, history, and maybe just a *little* bit of madness? You've come to the right place. This generator will spin you a name so epic, George R.R. Martin himself might steal it for his next book (no promises, though!).",
  "howToUse": [
    "Click the 'Generate' button. Like, seriously, just mash it. That's the magic right there.",
    "Keep clicking! The more you generate, the higher the chance of finding *the one*. (Think of it like searching for the Holy Grail, but with less Templars and more dragons.)",
    "Found a name you love? Awesome! Now go write a 10-book series about your House's rise to power (and inevitable tragic downfall).",
    "If you're *really* feeling adventurous, combine elements from multiple generated names. 'House Ironwood of the Shadowfell' has a certain ring to it, doesn't it?"

    {
      "question": "Will this generator guarantee me a seat on the Iron Throne?",
      "answer": "Sadly, no. This generator is for names only. You'll need to handle the political maneuvering, backstabbing, and dragon-riding yourself. We recommend starting with a strong army and a cunning advisor."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are these names canon?",
      "answer": "Nope! These are original creations designed to capture the *spirit* of Game of Thrones. Think of them as fan-fiction names, but way cooler."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my D&D campaign?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! These names are perfect for any fantasy setting. Just be prepared for your players to start speaking in faux-medieval accents."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this generator powered by magic?",
      "answer": "Maybe. We're not telling. But we *did* sacrifice a rubber chicken to the algorithm to ensure maximum awesomeness."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like any of the generated names?",
      "answer": "Keep generating! Or, get creative and tweak them to your liking. After all, you're the Lord or Lady of your House now. You make the rules!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Will using a name from this generator summon a White Walker invasion?",
      "answer": "Highly unlikely. But just in case, stock up on dragonglass and Valyrian steel. Better safe than sorry, right?"
