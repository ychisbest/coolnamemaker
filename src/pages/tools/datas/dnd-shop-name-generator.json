      "question": "Are the generated names actually good?",
      "answer": "We think so! We've poured over countless fantasy novels, D&D sourcebooks, and our own imaginations to craft a generator that spits out names worthy of any campaign. But ultimately, the best name is the one that resonates with you and your players!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for commercial purposes?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Consider these names your gift from the gods of creativity. Use them in your games, novels, podcasts, or anything else your heart desires. Just don't blame us if your players start expecting discounts at 'The Gilded Goblin'!"
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like any of the generated names?",
      "answer": "Keep generating! With a virtually limitless combination of prefixes and suffixes, you're bound to find something you love. Or, use the generator as a springboard for your own ideas. Sometimes, all it takes is a little spark to ignite your imagination."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this generator help me run a better D&D game?",
      "answer": "A great shop name can certainly add flavor and immersion to your game. But a truly amazing D&D experience comes from your storytelling, your players' choices, and a healthy dose of imagination. Consider this generator a tool to enhance, not replace, your own creative prowess."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this generator powered by magic?",
      "answer": "Well... not *technically*. But we've infused it with enough caffeine and fantasy lore to make it feel like magic. So, yeah, basically magic."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest new prefixes or suffixes?",
      "answer": "We'd love to hear your ideas! Send them our way, and we might just add them to the generator. Together, we can create an even more amazing resource for D&D Dungeon Masters."
