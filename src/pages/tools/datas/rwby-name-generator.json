    {
      "question": "What exactly *is* RWBY?",
      "answer": "RWBY is an American anime-style web series created by Monty Oum for Rooster Teeth. It's about four girls\u2014Ruby, Weiss, Blake, and Yang\u2014who train to become Huntresses at Beacon Academy to protect the world of Remnant from creatures known as the Grimm."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the generator work?",
      "answer": "Our generator uses a carefully curated list of prefixes and suffixes inspired by the RWBY universe. It combines them in a way that sounds both unique and fitting for a character in the show. A touch of magic might also be involved... but mostly it's just clever coding!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my RWBY fan fiction?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Go wild! That's what it's here for. Just remember to give credit where it's due (to the generator, or to the inspiration of RWBY)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are these names *actually* canon?",
      "answer": "Nope! These are fan-generated names. While we strive for authenticity, these names aren't officially part of the RWBY universe. But hey, maybe Monty Oum would have approved!"
    },
    {
      "question": "I got a really weird name. Is it broken?",
      "answer": "Sometimes, the random generator throws out a curveball. If you get a name that seems a bit... off... just hit the 'Generate' button again. Embrace the chaos, or try again for something a little less unusual!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes and suffixes to add to the generator?",
      "answer": "We'd love to hear your suggestions! Send them our way. We're always looking for ways to improve the generator and make it even more awesome."
