  "introduction": "Tired of calling your sword 'Swordy'? Does 'Stabby' lack a certain *je ne sais quoi*? Fear not, noble adventurer! Our Sword Name Generator is here to rescue you from the abyss of bland blade branding. We'll help you name your weapon with the power and prestige it deserves. Prepare for names so cool, they'll make even Excalibur jealous!",
  "howToUse": [
    "Simply click the 'Generate' button. It's basically magic, but without the pointy hats (unless you want to wear one, we don't judge).",
    "Keep clicking until you find a name that resonates with your soul (or at least doesn't sound like a dishwashing liquid).",
    "Copy and paste your chosen name onto your sword. We recommend using a permanent marker for maximum impact (and minimal washing off).",
    "Go forth and conquer! (Or just show off your awesome new sword name to your friends.)"

      "question": "Is this generator really free?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We believe everyone deserves a cool sword name, regardless of their gold coin situation. It's our gift to the world (or at least the portion of it that needs sword names)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my book/game/D&D character?",
      "answer": "Go for it! We're happy to fuel your creative endeavors. Just promise to name a character after us... or at least give us a shout-out in the credits. \ud83d\ude09"
    },
    {
      "question": "Will these names actually make my sword sharper?",
      "answer": "While we can't guarantee increased sharpness, a cool name *might* intimidate your opponents enough to make them surrender before you even swing. It's psychological warfare at its finest!"
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like any of the generated names?",
      "answer": "Keep clicking! We have an infinite supply of names (or at least a *very* large one). Or, you know, get creative and mix and match prefixes and suffixes. The possibilities are endless!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this generator safe to use?",
      "answer": "Safer than wielding a real sword! We promise no viruses, malware, or unexpected encounters with dragons. Just pure, unadulterated sword-naming fun."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest new prefixes or suffixes?",
      "answer": "We'd love to hear your ideas! Send them our way, and we might just add them to the generator. Help us make the world a more awesomely-named place, one sword at a time."
