      "question": "Is this generator actually related to Blizzard Entertainment?",
      "answer": "While we're huge fans of World of Warcraft, this generator is purely fan-made. We're just here to help you find the perfect Orc name, not to replace Thrall (yet)."

      "question": "Can I use these names for other games or stories?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! These names are designed with the spirit of Orcish culture in mind, so feel free to adapt them for any fantasy setting you desire. Just don't blame us if your friends start calling you 'Grommash' in real life."

    {
      "question": "The names are too similar! Can you make them more diverse?",
      "answer": "We're always working to improve our generator! If you have suggestions for new prefixes or suffixes, please let us know. The more input we get, the more epic the names will become."

    {
      "question": "Help! I accidentally named my Orc 'Princess Sparklehoof'. Can I change it?",
      "answer": "Unfortunately, we can't help you with in-game name changes. Contact Blizzard Support for assistance. And maybe lay off the Felweed before your next naming session..."
