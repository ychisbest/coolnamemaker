      "question": "Is this generator safe to use?",
      "answer": "Relatively. Side effects may include: increased nightmares, sudden urges to build strange monuments, and a nagging feeling that you're being watched by something ancient and unknowable. Use at your own risk!"

      "answer": "Absolutely! Just be sure to credit coolnamemaker.com when you become the new high priest of a forgotten god. It's good karma (or whatever the cosmic equivalent is)."

      "answer": "While we can't guarantee a full-blown summoning, using these names is like sending a cosmic bat-signal. Who knows what might answer?"

    {
      "question": "I generated a name that sounds suspiciously like my neighbor's cat. Should I be worried?",
      "answer": "It could be a coincidence...or maybe your neighbor's cat is more than it seems. Either way, it's probably best not to leave out any tuna offerings. Just in case."

    {
      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes or suffixes for the generator?",
      "answer": "We're always open to expanding our collection of cosmic horrors! Send your suggestions our way. If they're suitably terrifying, we might just add them."
