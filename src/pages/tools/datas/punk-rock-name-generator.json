  "introduction": "So, you're ready to dive headfirst into the mosh pit of punk rock glory? Excellent! But every great punk rocker needs an equally awesome name.

    "Smash that 'Generate' button like you're smashing the system (gently, though, it's just a button).",
    "Keep clicking until you find a name that makes you wanna spike your hair and write a killer riff.",
    "Don't be afraid to mix and match! Take a prefix from one name and a suffix from another. Get creative!",
    "Once you've found 'The One,' shout it from the rooftops (or, you know, update your social media).",
    "Remember, the best punk rock names are the ones that make you feel like a total badass."

      "question": "What if I don't like any of the names?",
      "answer": "Then you're not trying hard enough! Keep hitting that 'Generate' button! Or, you know, use it as inspiration to come up with something even more outrageous."
