  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What exactly *is* an 'arcane' name?",
      "answer": "Think names that sound mysterious, magical, and a little bit dangerous. Names that hint at hidden knowledge and forbidden powers. Basically, names that would make Gandalf jealous."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for commercial purposes?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! These names are yours to command. Use them for your books, games, businesses \u2013 whatever your heart desires. Just don't blame us if you accidentally summon a demon."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names generated truly random?",
      "answer": "As random as the whims of the cosmos allow! We use a sophisticated (okay, maybe not *that* sophisticated) algorithm to combine prefixes and suffixes in unpredictable ways. Expect the unexpected."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will these names help me become a powerful sorcerer?",
      "answer": "We can't guarantee magical abilities, but a cool name is definitely a step in the right direction! Confidence is key, and a name like 'Xylos the Shadowbinder' is bound to turn heads (and maybe even bend reality a little)."
    },
    {
      "question": "I got a name I don't like. Is the generator broken?",
      "answer": "Nope! Taste is subjective, even in the arcane arts. Just click 'Generate' again! There are countless possibilities waiting to be discovered."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest new prefixes or suffixes?",
      "answer": "We're always open to suggestions! Send us your ideas and we'll see if they resonate with the arcane energies. Who knows, your contribution might inspire the next generation of wizards and warlocks!"
