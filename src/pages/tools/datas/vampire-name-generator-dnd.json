    {
      "question": "Are these names suitable for D&D characters?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! These names are crafted with D&D in mind, drawing inspiration from classic gothic horror and fantasy lore. They're perfect for adding depth and intrigue to your vampire character."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for other things besides D&D?",
      "answer": "Of course! Use them for books, games, roleplaying, or just to give yourself a cool vampire-themed nickname. The possibilities are as endless as immortality itself!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names randomly generated?",
      "answer": "Yes, the names are generated using a combination of prefixes, suffixes, and other elements to create unique and evocative results every time. There's a touch of dark magic in the algorithm, we swear!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Will the names always be 'evil' sounding?",
      "answer": "While many names have a dark and mysterious vibe, not all of them are inherently 'evil'. Some might sound aristocratic, ancient, or even alluring. It's up to you to decide how you want to interpret them!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get a duplicate name?",
      "answer": "It's possible, but highly unlikely! With the vast combination of prefixes and suffixes, the chances of getting the exact same name twice are slim. But hey, if it happens, maybe it's a sign you've found your true vampire identity!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I have to give credit if I use a name?",
      "answer": "While not required, a little nod to coolnamemaker.com would be greatly appreciated! Think of it as a small offering to the dark gods of name generation. Plus, it helps others find our awesome tool!"
