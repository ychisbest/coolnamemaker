      "question": "Is this generator actually going to make me a real noble?",
      "answer": "Sadly, no. While we can provide you with a fantastic noble-sounding last name, we can't guarantee a title or a castle. Maybe try winning the lottery?"

      "question": "Are the generated names unique?",
      "answer": "We do our best to create a wide variety of names, but there's always a chance of some overlap. If you're looking for absolute, 100% uniqueness, you might need to get *really* creative."

    {
      "question": "Will this generator help me get into a fancy country club?",
      "answer": "While a noble-sounding name might give you a slight edge, it's probably not a golden ticket. Good luck though!"
