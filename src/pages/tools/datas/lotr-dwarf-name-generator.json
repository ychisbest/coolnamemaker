    {
      "question": "Are these names actually from Lord of the Rings?",
      "answer": "While we're inspired by Tolkien's world, these names are newly generated. We aim for authenticity, but they aren't lifted directly from the books or movies. Think of them as names that *could* have been!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my Dungeons & Dragons character?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Feel free to use these names for any purpose you desire. They're perfect for tabletop RPGs, creative writing, or just plain fun."
    },
    {
      "question": "How are the names generated?",
      "answer": "Our generator uses a sophisticated (okay, maybe not *that* sophisticated) algorithm that combines prefixes and suffixes common in dwarven names. We also sprinkle in a bit of magic to ensure each name sounds suitably epic."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will the generator ever create the same name twice?",
      "answer": "It's possible, but unlikely! With a vast combination of prefixes and suffixes, the chances of generating the exact same name are slim. Consider it a rare and auspicious occurrence if it happens!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest new prefixes or suffixes?",
      "answer": "We'd love to hear your ideas! While we can't guarantee they'll be added, we're always looking for ways to improve the generator. Send your suggestions our way and who knows, you might just see your contribution in a future update!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this generator free to use?",
      "answer": "You betcha! Use it as much as you like, free of charge. Our gift to you, brave adventurer!"
