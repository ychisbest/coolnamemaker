      "question": "Can I use these names for my D&D character?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! These names are crafted to be the perfect fit for your valiant D&D Paladin, or any other fantasy role-playing game character. Go forth and smite evil!"

      "question": "Are the names generated completely random?",
      "answer": "While there's an element of randomness, our generator uses carefully curated prefixes and suffixes to create names that evoke a sense of holiness, strength, and righteousness. It's random... but *divinely* random."

    {
      "question": "Will these names work for female Paladins?",
      "answer": "Of course! While some names might lean towards the traditionally masculine, many are perfectly suitable for female Paladins. Feel free to mix and match or generate until you find the perfect fit for your character's vibe."

    {
      "question": "I got a silly-sounding name. Is the generator broken?",
      "answer": "Sometimes, the algorithm has a sense of humor! While we aim for epic and righteous, the unpredictable nature of randomness can occasionally produce a... unique result. Just hit 'Generate' again for a more serious option. Or, embrace the silliness! A Paladin named 'Sir Fluffington' could be legendary!"
