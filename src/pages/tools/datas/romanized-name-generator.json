      "question": "What exactly does 'Romanized' mean in this context?",
      "answer": "Great question! We take your input and apply linguistic techniques to give it a Roman-sounding twist. Think Latin prefixes, suffixes, and vowel shifts that evoke the feel of ancient Rome without necessarily being accurate Latin translations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for characters in my book or game?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! That's what this generator is for. Feel free to use any name generated for your creative projects. Just remember where you got the inspiration!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the generator using real Latin?",
      "answer": "While we draw inspiration from Latin, the generator focuses on creating names that *sound* Roman. The results may not be grammatically correct Latin, but they'll definitely have that classical vibe."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like any of the generated names?",
      "answer": "No problem! Just hit the 'Generate' button again. The generator will conjure up a new set of names. Keep trying until you find the perfect fit."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the generated names historically accurate?",
      "answer": "We aim for a Roman *feel* rather than strict historical accuracy. While some names might resemble real Roman names, others are purely creative interpretations. Use your best judgment when incorporating them into historical contexts."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I combine prefixes and suffixes from different generated names?",
      "answer": "Go for it! Feel free to mix and match elements from different generated names to create something truly unique and tailored to your vision. Experimentation is key!"
