    {
      "question": "Is this generator actually useful if I'm, you know, *in* prison?",
      "answer": "Probably not. Access to the internet might be a bit limited. But hey, maybe you can memorize a few names and impress your cellmates later."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my Dungeons & Dragons character?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! A hardened criminal background can add some serious depth to your rogue or fighter. Just be prepared to explain your character's... unique skill set."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will these names help me avoid getting shanked?",
      "answer": "We can't guarantee that. A cool name is a good start, but you might need to work on your intimidation tactics and situational awareness too."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are these names based on real criminals?",
      "answer": "Nope! They're purely fictional creations, inspired by the tropes and stereotypes of prison life. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental... and slightly concerning."
    },
    {
      "question": "My generated name is 'Fluffy Bunny.' Is the generator broken?",
      "answer": "It's not broken, just...surprising. Sometimes the toughest guys have the most unexpected nicknames. Embrace the irony! Or, you know, just generate another one."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I trademark the name that I generate?",
      "answer": "While we encourage creativity, we make no guarantees about the uniqueness or trademarkability of the generated names. Use at your own risk!"
