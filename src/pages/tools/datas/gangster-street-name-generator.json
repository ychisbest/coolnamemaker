      "question": "Is this generator actually going to make me a gangster?",
      "answer": "Absolutely not. This is purely for fun and creative purposes. We're generating *names*, not criminal records. Please use your newfound moniker responsibly."

    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my book/game/other creative project?",
      "answer": "Heck yeah! That's what it's here for. Consider it a gift from the streets... of the internet."
    },
    {
      "question": "The names are too intense! Can I tone it down?",
      "answer": "Sure, some names might be a bit... spicy. Feel free to mix and match prefixes and suffixes to create something that suits your specific vibe. Or just keep hitting 'Generate' until you find something milder."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names generated randomly?",
      "answer": "Yep! A carefully curated list of prefixes and suffixes are combined in a totally random way to give you a unique and unpredictable result every time."
    },
    {
      "question": "I don't like any of the names. What am I doing wrong?",
      "answer": "Nothing! Taste is subjective, my friend. Just keep generating! Eventually, you'll stumble upon a name that sings to your soul (or at least makes you chuckle). Also, make sure you're in the right *mood*. Maybe put on some gangster rap. You know, for inspiration."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes or suffixes to be added?",
      "answer": "We're always open to suggestions! Send us your ideas via the contact form on the website. If they're cool enough, we might just add them to the mix."
