    {
      "question": "Is this generator only for houseplants?",
      "answer": "Absolutely not! Whether you've got a sprawling garden, a humble windowsill herb, or even a particularly enthusiastic patch of moss, this generator can find a name for it."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my pet?",
      "answer": "While these names are designed for plants, we're not the boss of you! If you think 'Sir Sproutington' is the perfect name for your hamster, go for it! Just be prepared for some confused looks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names generated scientifically accurate?",
      "answer": "Nope! We prioritize fun and creativity over botanical accuracy. If you're looking for a scientifically accurate name, consult a botanist (or Wikipedia)."
    },
    {
      "question": "I generated a name that's already in use. What do I do?",
      "answer": "Consider it a sign! Great minds (and plant parents) think alike. You can either tweak the name slightly or generate a new one. The choice is yours!"
    },
    {
      "question": "My plant died. Can I still use the name?",
      "answer": "Of course! Consider it a tribute to your fallen friend. Or, you know, recycle the name for your next botanical adventure."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any inappropriate names generated?",
      "answer": "We've done our best to keep things PG (Plant-G rated!), but the internet is a wild place. If you encounter a name you find offensive, please let us know, and we'll prune it from the garden."
