    "Behold! Your new, chrome-plated Mad Max name appears!",

      "question": "Is this generator actually related to the Mad Max franchise?",
      "answer": "We're huge fans! While not officially endorsed, we've poured our love for the saga into creating names that feel right at home in the Wasteland."

    {
      "question": "Are the names generated completely random?",
      "answer": "Yes and no. We use a carefully curated list of prefixes and suffixes designed to evoke the gritty, brutal feel of the Mad Max universe. So while the combinations are random, the vibe is always Wasteland-approved."

    {
      "question": "Will I become a better driver if I use a Mad Max name?",
      "answer": "We can't guarantee improved driving skills, but you'll definitely *feel* like you can take on a convoy of War Boys. (Please don't actually do that.)"

      "question": "I generated a name I really like! Can I save it?",
      "answer": "While this generator doesn't have a built-in save function, you can always copy and paste your favorite names into a document or note. That way, they're yours forever... or at least until the digital apocalypse."

    {
      "question": "What if I don't like any of the names I generate?",
      "answer": "Keep hitting that 'Generate' button! With enough tries, you're bound to find a name that resonates with your inner Furiosa. And hey, even in the Wasteland, persistence pays off."
