      "question": "Is this generator really free?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Our Insect Name Generator is completely free to use. We believe everyone deserves a chance to name their imaginary (or real!) bugs with style."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for commercial purposes?",
      "answer": "You sure can! Once a name pops out of the generator, it's all yours. Use it for your business, your book, your game \u2013 whatever your heart desires. (Just don't blame us if your bug-themed bakery becomes *too* popular.)"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names generated completely random?",
      "answer": "We use a sophisticated (okay, maybe not *that* sophisticated) algorithm that combines insect-related words, sounds, and syllables to create unique and interesting names. So, yes, they're pretty darn random, but with a touch of insectoid flair!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Will the generator create the same name twice?",
      "answer": "While it's *technically* possible, the odds are incredibly low. We've made sure there's a vast combination of options, so you're more likely to find a unicorn riding a bicycle than get the same name twice."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest words to be added to the generator?",
      "answer": "We'd love to hear your ideas! Send us your suggestions through our contact form, and we'll consider adding them to our database. Help us make the Insect Name Generator even more buggy-licious!"
    },
    {
      "question": "What kind of insect-related terms does it use?",
      "answer": "We've got everything from scientific terms to creepy crawly nicknames. Think 'Chitinous Whisper' meets 'Fuzzy Butt'."
