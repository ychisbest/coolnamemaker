      "question": "Is this generator actually going to find my soulmate?",
      "answer": "While we'd love to promise you a fairytale ending, this generator is purely for entertainment. Think of it as a fun way to spark your imagination, not a replacement for therapy or a dating coach."

      "question": "Can I use these names for my characters in a book or game?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Go wild! We encourage you to unleash your creativity and give these names a life beyond the generator. Just promise to mention us in the acknowledgements when you become a famous author/game developer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names generated randomly?",
      "answer": "Yes, the names are generated using a blend of prefixes and suffixes to create unique and (hopefully) amusing combinations. There's a touch of algorithm magic, but mostly it's just good old-fashioned silliness."
    },
    {
      "question": "I got a really weird name. Is something wrong?",
      "answer": "Nope, that's perfectly normal! Embrace the weirdness! Some of the names might be a little... out there. But that's part of the fun, right? If you don't like it, just generate another one!"

    {
      "question": "Can I suggest new prefixes or suffixes for the generator?",
      "answer": "We'd love to hear your ideas! Send us your suggestions and we'll see if we can incorporate them into the generator. The more ridiculous, the better!"

    {
      "question": "Is this generator free?",
      "answer": "Yes! Use it as much as you want, we are not charging anything. But if you really like it, share it with your friends!"
