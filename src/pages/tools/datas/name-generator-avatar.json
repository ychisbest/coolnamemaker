      "question": "Is this generator officially affiliated with Avatar: The Last Airbender or The Legend of Korra?",
      "answer": "Nope! We're just huge fans who wanted to create a fun tool for fellow Avatar enthusiasts. This is purely a fan-made project, so don't expect any official blessings from Republic City."

    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for commercial purposes?",
      "answer": "While we can't stop you, these names are primarily intended for personal enjoyment. If you plan on using a generated name for something commercial, we recommend checking for trademark issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this generator create names that are already in the Avatar universe?",
      "answer": "It's possible, but unlikely. We've tried to create a diverse range of options, but there's always a chance of serendipitous overlap. If you do get a name from the show, consider it a sign from the Spirit World!"

      "question": "How many names can this generator create?",
      "answer": "Technically, quite a lot! With the combinations of prefixes and suffixes, you're looking at hundreds, if not thousands, of potential names. Keep clicking until you find the perfect one!"

    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes or suffixes to add to the generator?",
      "answer": "We'd love to hear your ideas! Send them our way through our contact form on coolnamemaker.com. We're always looking for ways to improve the generator and make it even more awesome."
