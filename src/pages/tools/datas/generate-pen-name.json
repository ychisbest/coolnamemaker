    {
      "question": "How do I choose the right pen name?",
      "answer": "Consider your writing style, target audience, and personal preferences. Do you want something serious and professional, or fun and quirky? A good pen name should be memorable, easy to pronounce, and reflect your brand as an author."

      "question": "Can I use the same pen name for multiple genres?",

      "question": "What if the pen name I want is already taken?",
      "answer": "Don't despair! Try adding a middle initial, changing the spelling slightly, or using a variation of the name. You can also brainstorm similar names that capture the same essence. And always, always check trademark databases!"
