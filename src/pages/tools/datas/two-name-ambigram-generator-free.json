  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What exactly *is* an ambigram?",
      "answer": "An ambigram is a visual word or design that retains meaning when viewed from a different perspective, usually upside down. Think of it as a linguistic optical illusion!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this generator *really* free?",
      "answer": "Yes! Absolutely, positively, 100% free! We believe that everyone should have the chance to create awesome ambigrams without breaking the bank."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these ambigrams for commercial purposes?",
      "answer": "You sure can! Once you generate an ambigram, it's yours to use as you see fit. Go forth and brand, my friend!"
    },
    {
      "question": "What if the names I enter don't work well together?",
      "answer": "Some name combinations are trickier than others. Try experimenting with different spellings or nicknames to see if you can achieve a better result.  Sometimes, the less obvious the connection, the more impressive the ambigram!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any limitations to the length of the names?",
      "answer": "Shorter names generally work better, but feel free to experiment! Longer names might result in a more complex and less readable ambigram, but hey, sometimes complex is cool!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get a tattoo of the ambigram I generate?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! But PLEASE show your tattoo artist the design and make sure they can accurately reproduce it. A bad ambigram tattoo is a sad tattoo. Also, send us a picture, we'd love to see it!"
