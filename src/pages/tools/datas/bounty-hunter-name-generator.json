      "question": "Is this generator really free?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We're all about empowering aspiring bounty hunters with awesome names, without charging them a single credit. Consider it a public service."

      "question": "What if I don't like any of the generated names?",
      "answer": "Keep hitting that 'Generate' button! With so many possibilities, you're bound to find one that resonates with your inner bounty hunter. Or, you know, come up with your own. We won't judge (much)."

      "question": "Will using one of these names automatically make me a successful bounty hunter?",
      "answer": "While we can't guarantee intergalactic fame and fortune, a cool name is definitely a step in the right direction. The rest is up to your skills, your ship, and a little bit of luck!"

      "answer": "We suppose so, but we don't recommend it. A majestic name like 'Vanguard Rex' might be wasted on a slimy gastropod. But hey, it's your space slug!"
