      "question": "Is this generator actually going to make me a better Path of Exile player?",
      "answer": "Probably not. But you'll *look* cooler while you're getting wrecked by Kitava. And that's what really matters, right?"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for other games?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! While tailored for Path of Exile, these names can be adapted for any fantasy RPG, tabletop game, or even naming your pet hamster (if you're feeling particularly edgy)."

    {
      "question": "Are the generated names lore-friendly?",
      "answer": "We've tried to capture the dark and gritty essence of Wraeclast, but ultimately, it's about having fun! Some names might be more 'lore-adjacent' than others. Think of it as alternate universe naming."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many names can I generate?",
      "answer": "Generate to your heart's content! There's no limit. Keep those names coming until you find the one that truly speaks to your Exile's soul (or at least sounds vaguely threatening)."

      "answer": "Well, that's just unfortunate. But seriously, keep trying! With enough clicks, you're bound to find a gem. Or, you know, just go with 'Bob'. No judgment."
