  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Are these names *actually* Valyrian?",
      "answer": "While we can't guarantee 100% authenticity (we haven't exactly been hanging out with Daenerys), we've studied the naming conventions from the books and show to create names that feel authentically Valyrian.  Think of it as 'Valyrian-inspired'."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my book?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Consider it a gift from the Mother of Dragons (that's us!).  Just maybe give us a shout-out in the acknowledgements?  We're not greedy... just looking for a little dragon-love."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like any of the generated names?",
      "answer": "Keep hitting that 'Generate' button!  There are countless combinations, and eventually, you'll find the name that sings to your soul.  Or, you know, just tweak one you almost like.  We won't tell."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I combine prefixes and suffixes myself?",
      "answer": "Go for it!  Get creative!  We've provided the building blocks, but you're the architect of your own Valyrian destiny.  Just don't blame us if you accidentally create a name that sounds like a sneeze."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this generator free?",
      "answer": "As free as a dragon soaring through the sky! Use it as much as you want, no strings (or dragon chains) attached."

    {
      "question": "Will using a Valyrian name make me better at role-playing?",
      "answer": "While we can't promise you'll suddenly become a master strategist or dragon rider, having a cool name is definitely a step in the right direction. Confidence is key, and a Valyrian name oozes confidence!"
