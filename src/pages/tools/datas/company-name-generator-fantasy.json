  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Are these names actually fantasy-themed?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We've consulted with wizards, elves, and even a particularly chatty gargoyle to ensure authenticity. Though, occasionally, a rogue 'Bob' slips through. Apologies in advance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my D&D campaign?",
      "answer": "Of course! Feel free to name your tavern, your guild, or even your villain's evil lair with our generated names. Just don't blame us if your players get suspicious of 'The Whispering Pickle'."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I combine parts of different generated names?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Mix and match to your heart's content. Frankenstein-ing names is half the fun!"
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I need a name that sounds more\u2026 evil?",
      "answer": "Keep generating! We've got plenty of names with a sinister edge. Look for words like 'Shadow,' 'Night,' 'Doom,' or anything involving ravens. Those guys are always up to no good."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this generator powered by actual magic?",
      "answer": "We can neither confirm nor deny the presence of arcane energies. But let's just say we have a very friendly relationship with the local dragon."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my book?",
      "answer": "Yes! Feel free to use our generated names for your characters, locations, or anything else you need for your book. We're here to help you bring your fantasy world to life."
