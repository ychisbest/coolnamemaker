  "introduction": "Ever dreamt of having your own R2-D2 or C-3PO? Well, the first step is giving your droid a name that's worthy of the Star Wars universe! This generator combines prefixes and suffixes from across the galaxy to create unique and memorable droid names. Get ready to roll!",
  "howToUse": [
    "Simply click the 'Generate' button. It's easier than fixing a hyperdrive!",
    "Like a name? Awesome! Save it, share it, or shout it from the rooftops of Mos Eisley!",
    "Don't like the generated name? No sweat! Hit 'Generate' again for a fresh, new possibility. We've got more combinations than there are stars in the sky!",
    "Feeling creative? Mix and match prefixes and suffixes yourself to create a truly unique name. May the Force (and a good name) be with you!"
  ],
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is this generator actually powered by the Force?",
      "answer": "While we can't confirm the direct involvement of the Force, we *can* guarantee that the names are generated with a healthy dose of Star Wars inspiration!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my Star Wars fan fiction?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Go forth and create epic tales! Just remember, with great names comes great responsibility (to the Star Wars lore). \ud83d\ude09"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are these names canon?",
      "answer": "Officially? No. But who's to say your droid isn't the long-lost cousin of R2-D2? Use your imagination!"
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I want a more serious, less silly name?",
      "answer": "Keep generating! While we aim for fun, there are plenty of combinations that result in more serious and imposing droid names. Experiment and find what suits your mechanical pal best!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this generator help me build my own droid?",
      "answer": "Sadly, no. But it *will* give you a fantastic name for when you finally do! Start with the name, then build the droid. That's how they do it in the movies... probably."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes or suffixes for the generator?",
      "answer": "We'd love to hear your ideas! Send them our way and we might just add them to the mix. The more, the merrier (and the more droid names, the better)!"
