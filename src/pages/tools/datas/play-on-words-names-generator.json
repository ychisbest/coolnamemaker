    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my business?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Just be sure to check that the name isn't already taken and that it aligns with your brand's image (unless your brand's image is delightfully absurd)."

    {
      "question": "What if I don't understand the pun?",
      "answer": "Don't worry, it happens to the best of us! Some puns are more obscure than others. Feel free to Google it or ask a pun-loving friend for clarification. Or just pretend you get it and laugh along \u2013 no one will know the difference!"

    {
      "question": "Are the names generated completely random?",
