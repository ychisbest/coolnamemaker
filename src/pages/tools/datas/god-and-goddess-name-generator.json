  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is this generator really going to give me a *real* god or goddess name?",
      "answer": "While we can't guarantee it'll be *exactly* what Zeus's mom called him, our generator draws inspiration from various mythologies and languages to create names that *feel* authentically divine. Think of it as a creative springboard!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for commercial purposes?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Once generated, the names are yours to use as you see fit. Go forth and conquer the world (or at least sell a few copies of your book)!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names generated culturally sensitive?",
      "answer": "We strive to create names that are respectful and avoid cultural appropriation. However, please use your best judgment and consider the context in which you're using the names. If something feels off, it probably is."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes or suffixes to be added to the generator?",
      "answer": "We'd love to hear your suggestions! Feel free to reach out to us through our contact form. We're always looking for ways to improve the generator and make it even more awesome."
    },
    {
      "question": "My generated name sounds a bit... weird. Is that normal?",
      "answer": "Hey, even the gods have their off days! Sometimes the combinations might be a little unusual, but that's part of the fun. Embrace the weirdness, or simply generate another name. There are infinite possibilities, after all!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does this generator also create domains of influence for the gods and goddesses?",
      "answer": "While this generator focuses on the names themselves, consider the sound and feel of the name as inspiration for their domain. A name like 'Veridia' might suggest a goddess of truth or nature, while 'Kryllos' could be a god of shadows or the underworld."
