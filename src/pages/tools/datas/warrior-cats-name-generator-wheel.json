  "howToUse": [
    "First, take a deep breath, channel your inner feline, and think about the qualities you want your Warrior Cat to embody.",
    "Next, simply click the 'Spin' button (or tap it, if you're on a touchscreen - cats have paws, after all!).",
    "The wheel will magically generate a prefix and suffix, combining them to create a unique Warrior Cat name.",
    "Don't like the first result? No problem! Spin again! We have countless combinations to explore. Keep spinning until you find a name that resonates with your soul (or, you know, your cat-sona).",
    "Once you've found the purr-fect name, write it down, memorize it, and prepare to embark on your Warrior Cat adventure!",
    "Pro-Tip: For extra fun, consider your cat's appearance or personality when choosing a name. Does your cat have fiery fur? Perhaps 'Flame' would be a fitting prefix. Is your cat particularly wise? Maybe 'Sage' is the way to go!"
