  "icon": "\ud83e\ude90",
  "introduction": "In the grim darkness of the far future, there are only planets... and they need names! Are you a budding Inquisitor, a seasoned Rogue Trader, or just a fan of the Warhammer 40,000 universe? Then you've come to the right place. Our generator will churn out names that sound suitably epic, grim, and vaguely Latin-sounding, perfect for your next campaign, fanfic, or just to impress your friends with your knowledge of the Imperium's cartography.",
  "howToUse": [
    "Click the 'Generate' button. (Duh!)",
    "Marvel at the sheer awesomeness of the planet name that appears before you.",
    "If you don't like it, click 'Generate' again. The galaxy is vast; there are plenty of names to choose from!",
    "Copy and paste your favorite names into your campaign notes, fanfiction, or whatever dark corner of the internet you inhabit.",
    "Remember, with great planetary naming power comes great responsibility. Don't name a planet 'Bob'. The Emperor would not approve."

    {
      "question": "Is this generator lore-accurate?",
      "answer": "We've done our best to capture the *feel* of 40k planet names, but ultimately, it's meant to be fun. Don't expect it to be 100% canon. Think of it as 'inspired by' rather than 'official'."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my Warhammer 40,000 roleplaying game?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! That's what it's here for. Go forth and populate the galaxy with worlds of your own creation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this generator create names for specific factions (e.g., Eldar, Orks)?",
      "answer": "Not specifically. The names are designed to be generic enough to fit the overall tone of the 40k universe, but you might find some that lean towards certain factions depending on your interpretation. Use your imagination!"
    },
    {
      "question": "I got a really weird name. Is that a bug?",
      "answer": "Probably not! The 40k universe is a weird place. Embrace the strangeness! If you get something truly unpronounceable, just regenerate."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this generator endorsed by Games Workshop?",
      "answer": "Nope. This is a fan-made tool. We're just enthusiasts sharing our love of the grim darkness of the far future."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes or suffixes to add to the generator?",
      "answer": "We're always open to suggestions! Feel free to reach out with your ideas. If they're suitably grimdark, we might just add them."
