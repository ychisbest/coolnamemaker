      "question": "How does the generator come up with these names?",
      "answer": "Our generator uses a sophisticated algorithm (okay, it's just a bunch of cool words and phrases) to create a wide variety of cruise line names. We combine prefixes, suffixes, and keywords to generate unique and memorable options."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names generated trademarked?",

      "question": "Can I use the generated names for free?",
      "answer": "Yes, you're welcome to use the generated names for inspiration or even as your actual cruise line name (after checking for trademark availability, of course!)."
    },
    {
      "question": "The names are terrible! What gives?",
      "answer": "Hey, taste is subjective! If you're not vibing with the initial results, try generating a few more times. You can also try adding keywords to steer the generator in a direction you prefer. If all else fails, blame the algorithm \u2013 it's always a safe bet."
