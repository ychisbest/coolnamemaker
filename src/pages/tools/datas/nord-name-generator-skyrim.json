    {
      "question": "Are these names actually from Skyrim?",
      "answer": "While we can't guarantee that every name is *directly* from the game, we've meticulously researched Nord naming conventions to create names that feel authentic and lore-friendly. Think of it as inspired by, rather than ripped from, Tamriel!"

    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for other things besides Skyrim?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! These names are perfect for fantasy characters, stories, games, or even just a cool nickname. Go wild! We won't tell anyone if you name your pet hamster 'Bjorn Iron-Paw'."

    {
      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes or suffixes for the generator?",
      "answer": "We'd love to hear your ideas! Send us your suggestions via our contact form, and we'll consider adding them in a future update. Maybe your suggestion will become the next legendary Nord name!"

      "answer": "Sadly, no. But it will give you a head start on roleplaying as one! You'll have the name, now all you need is the Thu'um."
