  "howToUse": [
    "Simply click the 'Generate' button and behold! A brand new fortress name, forged in the fires of Mount Doom (okay, maybe not, but it's still pretty cool).",
    "Don't like the first result? No problem! Keep clicking until you strike gold (or at least something shiny).",
    "Feeling creative? Mix and match prefixes and suffixes to craft a name that's uniquely *yours*.",
    "Once you find the perfect name, copy it and paste it into your Dwarf Fortress game. Your dwarves will thank you (probably by getting eaten by a forgotten beast, but still).",

    {
      "question": "What kind of names does this generator create?",
      "answer": "We aim for names that feel authentic to the Dwarf Fortress universe \u2013 think grandiose, descriptive, and maybe a little bit grim. Expect a mix of mountain peaks, precious metals, and ominous warnings."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names actually *in* Dwarf Fortress?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. We're inspired by the game's naming conventions, but the generated names are unique creations. Consider them tributes to the spirit of Dwarf Fortress, not exact copies."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for other games or stories?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! A cool name is a cool name, no matter where it's used. Feel free to unleash your inner dwarf in any creative project."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this generator help me survive a goblin siege?",
      "answer": "Sadly, no. A good name won't stop a horde of goblins from tearing down your fortifications. But it *will* make your inevitable defeat sound way more epic."
    },
    {
      "question": "I generated a name that sounds really silly. Is that normal?",
      "answer": "Completely normal! Dwarf Fortress is a game of glorious absurdity. Embrace the silliness! Sometimes, the best names are the ones that make you laugh."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this generator endorsed by Toady One?",
      "answer": "Nope! This is a fan-made tool, crafted with love (and a healthy dose of dwarven stubbornness) for the Dwarf Fortress community."
