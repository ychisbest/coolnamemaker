      "question": "What exactly *is* a Bugbear?",
      "answer": "Imagine a hairy, hulking goblin with a penchant for violence and a talent for ambushing. That's a Bugbear! Think of them as the grumpy, overgrown cousins of goblins."

      "question": "Can I use these names for my D&D character?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! That's what it's for! Go forth and terrorize your fellow players with your magnificently monstrous name."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are these names actually...good?",
      "answer": "That's a great question! Our names are generated using a complex algorithm that takes into account the sounds and syllables that are most associated with Bugbear names. We also use a database of existing Bugbear names to ensure that our generated names are as authentic as possible."

    {
      "question": "Will using a Bugbear name make me stronger?",
      "answer": "While we can't guarantee that using a Bugbear name will make you stronger, we can guarantee that it will make you feel more confident and powerful. After all, who wouldn't be intimidated by someone with a name like 'Gnashfang' or 'Skullcrusher'?"

    {
      "question": "Is this generator suitable for children?",
      "answer": "Our Bugbear Name Generator is designed to be fun and engaging for people of all ages, but we recommend that parents supervise their children's use of the generator. Some of the names generated by the generator may be considered scary or offensive by some people, so it's important to make sure that children are aware of this before they use the generator."
