      "question": "What exactly *is* a Sangheili?",
      "answer": "Ah, a fair question, Human! Sangheili, also known as Elites, are a proud and powerful warrior race in the Halo universe, known for their honor, skill in combat, and distinctive mandibles."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are these names 'official' Sangheili names?",
      "answer": "While we strive for authenticity, these names are generated based on the established naming conventions in Halo lore. Think of them as inspired by, not necessarily canon."

      "answer": "Absolutely! That's what they're here for! Go forth and create epic tales of Sangheili heroism (or villainy... we don't judge)."

      "question": "Will this generator make me a better Halo player?",
      "answer": "While we can't guarantee improved aiming skills, having a truly awesome Sangheili name might intimidate your opponents... or at least make them laugh before you utterly destroy them."

      "question": "Are there any Sangheili names I *shouldn't* use?",
      "answer": "Avoid names that are already well-established in the Halo universe (like Arbiter or Rtas 'Vadum). Unless, of course, you're writing a very *interesting* fanfic. Also, maybe skip anything overtly offensive. Keep it classy, Elite."

    {
      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes or suffixes for the generator?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We're always looking to expand our database of Sangheili awesomeness. Send your suggestions our way!"
