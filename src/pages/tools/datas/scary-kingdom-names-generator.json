      "question": "What kind of names does this generator create?",
      "answer": "We specialize in names that evoke feelings of dread, fear, and ancient evil. Think gothic castles, haunted forests, and kingdoms ruled by tyrannical sorcerers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for commercial purposes?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! All generated names are free for you to use as you see fit. Create your next bestselling fantasy novel, design a terrifying video game, or even name your pet hamster 'The Shadowlands of Snuggles' (we won't judge)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names truly random?",
      "answer": "As random as a raven's caw in the dead of night! We use a sophisticated algorithm (okay, maybe not *that* sophisticated) to ensure a wide variety of terrifying possibilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will these names summon actual demons?",
      "answer": "We can't guarantee that. But if they do, please don't blame us. Maybe offer them a nice cup of tea and a biscuit. Politeness goes a long way, even in the underworld."

      "question": "I'm not feeling very scary today. Can I use this generator for something else?",
      "answer": "Sure! You could use it to name your Halloween decorations, your metal band, or even your particularly grumpy cat. The possibilities are endless (and potentially terrifying)."

    {
      "question": "How often is the generator updated with new names?",
      "answer": "We are constantly adding new and terrifying names to our database. Check back regularly for fresh doses of dread!"
