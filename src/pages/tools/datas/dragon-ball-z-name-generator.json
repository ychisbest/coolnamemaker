  "howToUse": [
    "Simply click the 'Generate' button. It's easier than powering up to Super Saiyan!",
    "Don't like the name? Keep clicking! We've got more combinations than there are Dragon Balls.",

      "question": "Is this generator actually endorsed by Akira Toriyama?",
      "answer": "While we wish it were, sadly no. This is just a fan-made tool for fun. But hey, maybe he'll use it someday!"

      "question": "Can I use these names for my Dragon Ball Z fan fiction?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Go wild! Just remember to give credit where credit is due (to the awesome power of random name generation!)."

    {
      "question": "Will this generator give me a power level?",
      "answer": "Unfortunately, no power levels are included. You'll have to sense that yourself, maybe try shouting really loud. (Results may vary.)"

    {
      "question": "What if I don't like any of the generated names?",
      "answer": "Keep hitting that 'Generate' button! With so many combinations, you're bound to find a name that resonates with your inner Super Saiyan. Or, you know, just refresh the page and start again."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this generator compatible with my scouter?",
      "answer": "Probably not, but it's definitely more stylish. Plus, it won't explode if someone's power level is too high. (Seriously, those things were unreliable.)"

      "question": "Can I request specific prefixes or suffixes?",
      "answer": "While we can't take individual requests, we're always looking for ways to improve the generator! Feel free to send us your suggestions!"
