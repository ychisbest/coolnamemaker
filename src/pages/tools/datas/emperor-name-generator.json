      "question": "Is this generator actually going to make me an emperor?",
      "answer": "Sadly, no. We're name generators, not miracle workers. But hey, a great name is a start, right?"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my fantasy novel?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Go forth and populate your world with emperors, empresses, and all manner of regal figures. Just promise to credit us (kidding... mostly!)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names generated historically accurate?",
      "answer": "Not particularly. We're going for cool and evocative, not necessarily historically sound. Think 'fantasy emperor' rather than 'textbook emperor'."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like any of the generated names?",
      "answer": "Then you, my friend, are a tough customer! But fear not, the generator is designed to produce a virtually infinite number of names. Keep clicking until you find one that resonates with your inner emperor."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there a limit to how many names I can generate?",
      "answer": "Nope! Generate to your heart's content. We won't judge (unless you start naming your pets after them... then we might judge a little)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes or suffixes for the generator?",
      "answer": "We're always open to suggestions! Feel free to reach out and let us know your ideas. If they're suitably regal, we might just add them!"
