    "Keep clicking until a name tickles your fancy and makes your wand hand tingle.",
    "Don't be afraid to mix and match prefixes and suffixes if you're feeling particularly creative \u2013 who knows what magical combinations you might discover?",

      "question": "Is this generator really magical?",
      "answer": "While we can't guarantee it's powered by actual unicorn tears, the results are pretty darn enchanting. Use with a pinch of skepticism and a whole lot of fun!"

      "question": "Can I use these names for my fantasy novel?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Consider it a gift from our creative coven to yours. Just promise to mention us in your acknowledgements (kidding... mostly!)."

    {
      "question": "What if I don't like any of the generated names?",
      "answer": "Keep clicking! The generator has more tricks up its sleeve than a stage magician. Or, try combining elements from different names to create something truly unique."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names trademarked?",
      "answer": "Nope! But before you commit, it's always a good idea to do a quick search to make sure no one else is already using your chosen name. We wouldn't want any legal dragons breathing down your neck."

      "question": "Can I use these names for something other than a magic shop?",
      "answer": "Of course! A little magic can enhance anything. Use them for your band, your pet goblin, your secret society... the possibilities are endless!"
