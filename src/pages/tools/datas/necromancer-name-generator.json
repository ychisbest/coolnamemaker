      "question": "Is this generator actually summoning names from the underworld?",
      "answer": "While we can't *guarantee* it, we've used some pretty dark magic to create this generator. So... maybe? Use at your own risk!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for commercial purposes?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Consider it a gift from the realm of the dead. Just don't blame us if your customers start complaining about ghostly apparitions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the generated names copyrighted?",
      "answer": "Nope! They're fresh out of the grave and free for you to use as you please. Though, if you become a wildly successful necromancer, maybe send us a thank you note (or a small portion of your soul)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like any of the generated names?",
      "answer": "Keep clicking! Or, you know, try combining different prefixes and suffixes. If all else fails, maybe necromancy isn't for you. Have you considered flower arranging?"
    },
    {
      "question": "Will using a necromancer name attract unwanted attention from demons or other dark entities?",
      "answer": "Possibly! But hey, at least you'll have a cool name to use when you're negotiating with them. We recommend having a good lawyer... and maybe a powerful exorcist on speed dial."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest new prefixes or suffixes for the generator?",
      "answer": "Yes, please! We're always looking for new ways to expand our arsenal of dark and spooky name components. Send your suggestions our way!"
