      "question": "Is this generator actually useful?",
      "answer": "Useful? Maybe not in the traditional sense. But if you need a name that won't raise any eyebrows, attract any attention, or be remembered by anyone, then YES! It's incredibly useless...ly awesome."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for serious purposes?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Go ahead and use them for anything you want. Just don't blame us if your bank rejects your application because your name is 'John Smithson'."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the generated names actually unique?",
      "answer": "We strive for uniqueness, but let's be real, there are only so many ways to be boring. You might get a name that sounds familiar. Embrace the clich\u00e9!"
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I want a *remarkable* name?",
      "answer": "Then you're in the wrong place, pal! Try our 'Supervillain Name Generator' or 'Galactic Warlord Name Generator'. We specialize in the opposite of remarkable here."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will using a 'Nobody' name make me invisible?",
      "answer": "Sadly, no. We're working on the invisibility cloak technology, but for now, you'll just have to settle for a name that makes people forget you exist. Close enough, right?"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did you create this?",
      "answer": "Because everyone deserves a chance to be completely, utterly, and wonderfully average. Also, we ran out of ideas for cool name generators."
