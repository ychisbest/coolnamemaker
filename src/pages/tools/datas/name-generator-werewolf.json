      "answer": "This generator creates names that evoke a sense of primal power, mystery, and ferocity, suitable for werewolves in various settings \u2013 from classic horror to modern fantasy."

    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for other creatures besides werewolves?",
      "answer": "Of course! While designed for werewolves, many of these names could also work for other beastly or monstrous characters in your stories."
