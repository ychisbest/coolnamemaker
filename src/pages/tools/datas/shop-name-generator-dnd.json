      "question": "Is this generator compatible with all D&D editions?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Whether you're playing 1st edition, 5th edition, or that weird homebrew edition your friend insists is balanced, this generator will work wonders."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my published D&D content?",
      "answer": "Go for it! But a small shoutout would be appreciated. We're just trying to avoid getting sued by a dragon."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like any of the generated names?",
      "answer": "That's impossible! But if, by some strange twist of fate, you're not satisfied, just keep generating! Or, you know, come up with your own. We won't judge... much."

      "question": "Will this generator help me attract more customers to my in-game shop?",
      "answer": "While we can't guarantee increased foot traffic (that's on your shop's inventory and your haggling skills), a great name is a great start! Who wouldn't want to visit 'The Glimmering Goblin's Trinkets'?"

    {
      "question": "Is this generator powered by actual magic?",
      "answer": "We'd like to think so. But it's probably just a bunch of code and a sprinkle of fairy dust. Don't tell anyone."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for other fantasy settings besides D&D?",
      "answer": "Of course! While geared towards D&D, these names work great for any fantasy role-playing game, novel, or even a quirky pet shop. The possibilities are endless!"
