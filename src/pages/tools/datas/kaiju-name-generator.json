      "question": "What exactly *is* a Kaiju?",
      "answer": "Kaiju is a Japanese word that literally translates to 'strange beast,' but is commonly used to refer to giant monsters like Godzilla, Mothra, and King Ghidorah. Basically, anything that can level a city in a single bound qualifies."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for commercial purposes?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Once the name is generated, it's yours to use as you see fit. Just try not to actually destroy any cities in the process."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names generated completely random?",
      "answer": "While the combination is random, we've curated the prefixes and suffixes to ensure they sound suitably monstrous and evocative. So, yes... but with a purpose!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this generator help me become a real Kaiju?",
      "answer": "Sadly, no. This generator is purely for naming purposes. We can't help you grow to 300 feet tall or develop atomic breath (yet!)."
