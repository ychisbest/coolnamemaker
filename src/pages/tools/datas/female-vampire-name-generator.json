      "question": "Are these names actually good, or just random syllables strung together?",
      "answer": "We've carefully curated our prefixes and suffixes to evoke a sense of gothic elegance and timeless power. While the combinations are random, the results are designed to sound authentically vampire-esque. We're aiming for 'Dracula's Daughter' not 'Blah McBlahface'."

      "question": "Can I use these names for commercial purposes, like in a book or game?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Once you generate the name, it's yours to use as you see fit. Just remember to credit coolnamemaker.com if you become a literary sensation. (We're kidding... mostly.)"

      "answer": "Keep clicking! With a vast library of prefixes and suffixes, the possibilities are virtually endless. If you *still* can't find something you like, try mixing and matching different parts of names or using them as inspiration for your own creations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this generator turn me into a real vampire?",
      "answer": "Sadly, no. This generator is purely for entertainment purposes. We cannot guarantee eternal life, heightened senses, or a crippling aversion to sunlight. But hey, at least you'll have a cool name!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this generator suitable for all ages?",
      "answer": "While the theme is dark and gothic, the names themselves are generally harmless. However, parental discretion is advised for younger users. We wouldn't want to give any impressionable youngsters ideas about sleeping in coffins or drinking blood (apple juice, of course!)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest new prefixes or suffixes for the generator?",
      "answer": "We're always open to suggestions! If you have a brilliant idea for a new name component, feel free to contact us through the website. We can't promise we'll use every suggestion, but we appreciate your input!"
