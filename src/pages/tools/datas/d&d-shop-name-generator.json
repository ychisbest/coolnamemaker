  "howToUse": [
    "Simply click the 'Generate' button. Seriously, that's it. We're not about to make you roll a Wisdom saving throw just to get a shop name.",

    "Steal a name you like, tweak it slightly, or use it as inspiration to craft your own masterpiece. We won't tell.",

      "question": "Is this generator actually magical?",
      "answer": "While we can't guarantee it's imbued with actual arcane energies, the results *are* pretty darn magical. Use with caution (and a healthy dose of imagination!)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my published D&D campaign?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Consider it a gift from one Dungeon Master to another. Just maybe give us a shout-out if your players are particularly impressed \ud83d\ude09."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like any of the generated names?",
      "answer": "Then you're probably a dragon hoarding gold and impossible to please. Just kidding! Keep generating! Or, use the prefixes and suffixes as inspiration to create something completely new."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are these names suitable for all D&D settings?",
      "answer": "We've tried to make them versatile enough for most settings, from Forgotten Realms to Eberron. But feel free to adapt them to fit your specific campaign world."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will using this generator make me a better Dungeon Master?",
      "answer": "It's a start! A great name can breathe life into your world and inspire your players. But remember, a good DM is also a skilled storyteller, a fair adjudicator, and a master of improvisation. Now go forth and DM!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does this generator support names for specific types of shops (e.g., blacksmiths, apothecaries)?",
      "answer": "While it's generalized, the combinations often suggest a specific type of establishment. Pay attention to the nuances! 'The Dragon's Hoard' is likely a treasure shop, while 'Elara's Elixirs' is probably an apothecary."
