That's where we come in. Our Slime Name Generator is here to provide you with the most delightfully disgusting, hilariously horrifying, and utterly unforgettable slime names this side of the primordial soup. Prepare to be slimed... with inspiration!",
  "howToUse": [
    "Click the 'Generate' button. (Duh!)",
    "Marvel at the sheer brilliance of the slime name bestowed upon you.",
    "Repeat until you find the slime name that truly resonates with your inner goo.",

      "question": "Is this generator actually going to turn me into slime?",
      "answer": "While we can generate a fantastic slime name, we can't guarantee actual slime transformation. That's more of a wizard thing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my pet slime?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! In fact, we encourage it. Your pet slime deserves a name as unique and squishy as they are."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names generated random?",
      "answer": "Mostly! We use a sophisticated (and slightly slimy) algorithm to combine prefixes and suffixes for maximum name-generating awesomeness."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like the name I get?",
      "answer": "Keep generating! There are countless slime name combinations waiting to be discovered. Don't settle for anything less than slime-tastic!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it safe to eat the slime names?",
      "answer": "Definitely not! While the names are delicious in concept, they are purely metaphorical. Please do not consume the generated names. Or actual slime, for that matter. Unless it's edible slime. Then, proceed with caution."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my band?",
      "answer": "Heck yes! Slime-themed bands are always a hit. Just imagine 'The Viscous Void' rocking out on stage. Pure slime-tastic chaos."
