      "answer": "We cannot guarantee that using these names will *not* summon unspeakable horrors from beyond the stars. Use at your own risk! (Disclaimer: We are not responsible for any loss of sanity, property damage, or existential dread that may result from using this generator.)"

      "question": "Is this generator safe to use?",
      "answer": "Safe is a relative term when dealing with cosmic horror.

You have been warned."
