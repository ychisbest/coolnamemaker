    {
      "question": "Is this generator *actually* Viking?",
      "answer": "Well, it's not like we're summoning the spirits of ancient Norsemen. But we've studied Viking naming conventions and lore to bring you names that *sound* authentically Viking. So, pretty darn close!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my D&D character?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! In fact, we encourage it. Go forth and conquer your campaign with a name that strikes fear into the hearts of your enemies (and impresses your DM)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the generated names male, female, or gender-neutral?",
      "answer": "We aim for a mix! Some names lean towards masculine or feminine, but many are suitable for any Viking warrior, regardless of gender. Let your axe do the talking!"

      "question": "Can I suggest names to add to the generator?",
      "answer": "We're always looking to expand our Viking name repertoire! Feel free to send us your suggestions. If they're suitably epic, we might just include them!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Will using a generated name automatically make me good at axe throwing?",
      "answer": "Sadly, no. But it *will* make you *feel* like you should be good at axe throwing. We recommend practicing responsibly (and away from small children and pets)."
