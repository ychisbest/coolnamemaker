    {
      "question": "What kind of names does this generator create?",
      "answer": "We conjure up names that evoke images of ancient forests, bubbling cauldrons, and maybe a slightly moldy cottage. Think earthy, mystical, and a little bit unsettling."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for commercial purposes?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Consider them a gift from the digital coven. Just maybe give us a shout-out if your hag character becomes a bestseller."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names generated completely random?",
      "answer": "Mostly! We've carefully curated prefixes and suffixes to ensure each name has that authentic hag-like quality. But the combination is entirely up to chance (and a little bit of digital magic)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this generator curse my computer?",
      "answer": "Highly unlikely. We use only the safest, most digitally friendly spells. However, if you start seeing toads in your browser, we recommend contacting a qualified IT witch."
    },
    {
      "question": "I don't feel like a hag. Can I still use this?",
      "answer": "Of course! Maybe you're a wizard in disguise, or a very misunderstood fairy. Everyone deserves a cool, slightly spooky name."
    },
    {
      "question": "My generated name is too scary! Help!",
      "answer": "Embrace the fear! Or, you know, just click 'Generate' again. We have plenty of names that are only *mildly* terrifying."
