      "question": "Will this name actually change my in-game name?",
      "answer": "Unfortunately, no. This generator helps you come up with cool name *ideas* for your Guardian or clan. You'll still need to change your name through the appropriate channels (usually your platform's account settings)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use spaces or special characters in my Destiny 2 name?",
      "answer": "That depends on the platform and Destiny 2's naming conventions. Check the game's official guidelines for the specifics. Our generator provides names that are generally compatible, but always double-check!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this generator officially endorsed by Bungie?",
      "answer": "Nope! We're just a bunch of Guardians who love Destiny 2 and wanted to help others find awesome names. We're not affiliated with Bungie in any way."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like any of the generated names?",
      "answer": "Keep clicking! Or, get creative! Use the generated names as inspiration and mix and match elements to create something truly unique. The possibilities are as vast as the solar system!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use this generator for other games besides Destiny 2?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! While it's tailored for Destiny 2, the generated names can work for any sci-fi or fantasy game where you need a cool, powerful-sounding character name."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are some names longer than others?",
      "answer": "We use a variety of prefixes and suffixes, some of which are naturally longer. This adds to the diversity of the generated names. If you prefer shorter names, just keep generating!"
