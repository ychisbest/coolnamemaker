  "introduction": "So, you wanna be a wiseguy? You've come to the right place. This isn't just about names; it's about crafting a persona, a legend whispered in back alleys and around dimly lit tables. Get ready to discover your inner Don!",
  "howToUse": [

      "question": "Is this generator actually connected to the Mafia?",
      "answer": "Absolutely not! This is purely for entertainment purposes. We wouldn't want to end up sleeping with the fishes."

      "question": "Can I use these names for my novel?",
      "answer": "Go right ahead! Just be sure to give us a shout-out in the acknowledgments. Maybe something like, 'Special thanks to coolnamemaker.com for helping me name my characters... or else.'"
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this generator help me become a real mafioso?",
      "answer": "Probably not. We recommend taking an acting class instead. Much safer, and you still get to yell things like 'Fuggedaboutit!'"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the generated names offensive?",
      "answer": "We aim for a playful, slightly stereotypical vibe, but we try to avoid anything genuinely offensive. If you find a name that rubs you the wrong way, just generate another one!"

      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes or suffixes for the generator?",
      "answer": "We're always open to suggestions! Send us your ideas \u2013 just don't ask us to 'take care of' anyone who disagrees with you."

    {
      "question": "What if I don't like the name it gives me?",
      "answer": "No problem! Just hit that generate button again. We've got more names than a family tree in Sicily."
