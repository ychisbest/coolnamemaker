    {
      "question": "What makes a good elven city name?",
      "answer": "Elven city names often evoke a sense of nature, history, and magic. Think of words that sound melodic, ancient, and slightly mysterious. They often incorporate elements of forests, rivers, stars, and legendary figures."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my D&D campaign?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! These names are perfect for D&D, Pathfinder, or any fantasy role-playing game. They'll add depth and flavor to your world."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are these names based on real elven languages?",
      "answer": "While not directly translated from specific elven languages (like those created by Tolkien), they are inspired by the sounds and structures of those languages. We aim for authenticity in feel, not necessarily direct translation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I trademark a name I generate here?",
      "answer": "While you *can* try, we don't guarantee the uniqueness of every generated name. Many fantasy elements are shared across different works. It's always best to do a thorough trademark search if you plan on using a name commercially."
    },
    {
      "question": "The generated name is a little weird. Is that normal?",
      "answer": "Sometimes! The generator uses a combination of different elements, and occasionally the results might be a bit unusual. But hey, maybe that's exactly what your unique elf city needs! If not, just generate another one!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my novel?",
      "answer": "Yes, you're free to use the generated names for your novel, game, or any other creative project. We only ask that you give credit where it is due and link back to coolnamemaker.com."
