    {
      "question": "Is this generator actually evil?",
      "answer": "While the names it generates are undeniably wicked, the generator itself is purely for entertainment purposes. We are not responsible for any world domination plans that may arise from using it."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my D&D campaign?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! These names are perfect for adding some extra villainous flair to your tabletop adventures. Just be prepared for your players to tremble in fear."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names generated original?",
      "answer": "We use a combination of carefully curated prefixes and suffixes to create unique and original names. While there's always a tiny chance of overlap, you can be confident that your team's name will be relatively distinct."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like any of the generated names?",
      "answer": "Keep clicking! We have a vast database of evil-sounding words and phrases. Eventually, you're bound to find a name that resonates with your inner villain. Or, get creative and mix and match elements from different names!"

    {
      "question": "Is there a limit to how many names I can generate?",
      "answer": "Nope! Generate as many villain team names as your dark heart desires. The more the merrier (and the eviler)!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes or suffixes for the generator?",
      "answer": "We're always looking for ways to expand our evil vocabulary! Feel free to send us your suggestions. If they're suitably sinister, we might just add them to the generator."
