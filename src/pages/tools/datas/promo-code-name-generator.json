We combine creativity and a dash of marketing magic to create codes that are memorable, relevant, and (most importantly) drive sales.",
  "howToUse": [
    "First, brainstorm a theme. Is it a summer sale? A back-to-school bonanza? Or just a general 'we love you' discount?",
    "Next, tweak the settings! Do you want something short and sweet? Or something longer and more descriptive?",
    "Finally, hit that 'Generate' button and watch the magic happen! If you don't like the first result, don't worry, we've got plenty more where that came from. Keep generating until you find the PERFECT code.",
    "Pro Tip: Consider your target audience! A promo code for a luxury brand should sound different than a promo code for a skateboarding company."
