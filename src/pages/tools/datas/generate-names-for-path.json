      "question": "Is this generator really free?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We believe that everyone deserves access to awesome names, regardless of budget. Consider it our gift to the internet."

    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names generated truly random?",
      "answer": "As random as we can make them! We use a complex algorithm (okay, maybe not *that* complex) to combine prefixes and suffixes in unexpected and delightful ways."
    },
    {
      "question": "I don't like any of the names. What am I doing wrong?",
      "answer": "Nothing! Naming is subjective. Just keep hitting that 'Generate' button. Eventually, you'll stumble upon a gem that's perfect for you. Or, you know, just blame the algorithm. It won't mind."

    {
      "question": "Will this generator name my pet?",
      "answer": "While technically you *could* use it for that, we primarily designed it for digital paths. But hey, if you end up naming your goldfish 'QuantumLeapDirectory,' send us a picture!"
