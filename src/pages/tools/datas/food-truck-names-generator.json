Let's get those creative juices flowing and find the perfect moniker for your rolling restaurant!",
  "howToUse": [
    "Simply click the 'Generate' button and watch the magic happen! \u2728",
    "Don't like the first few names? Keep clicking! We've got a whole buffet of options for you.",
    "Found a name you love? Write it down! (Or copy and paste, we're not judging.)",
    "Pro-tip: Say the name out loud a few times. Does it roll off the tongue? Does it make you hungry?",
    "Bonus points: Check if the name and a related domain name are available. You don't want to be stuck with 'Bob's Burgers' when BobsBurgers.com is already taken!"

    {
      "question": "How many names can I generate?",
      "answer": "As many as your heart (and stomach) desires! There's no limit. Keep clicking until you find 'the one'."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the generated names trademarked?",
      "answer": "Nope! These are just suggestions. You'll need to do your own research to make sure the name isn't already in use and to trademark it if you want to protect it."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for other businesses?",
      "answer": "Technically, yes. But they're designed for food trucks, so using 'Taco Titan' for your accounting firm might raise some eyebrows. \ud83d\ude09"
    },
    {
      "question": "The names are a little silly. Is that intentional?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Food trucks are all about fun and deliciousness. We aim for names that are memorable and bring a smile to people's faces."
    },
    {
      "question": "I generated a name I REALLY love! What's next?",
      "answer": "Congrats! Now it's time to check for trademark availability, register your business name, and start designing your food truck! We're so excited for you!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are these names suitable for all types of food trucks?",
      "answer": "We've tried to make them pretty versatile, but some might be better suited for certain cuisines. A name like 'Pizza Peddler' is probably better for pizza than for gourmet ice cream, you know?"
