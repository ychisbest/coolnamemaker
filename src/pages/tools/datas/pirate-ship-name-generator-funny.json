  "icon": "\ud83d\udea2",
  "introduction": "Let's face it, 'The Sea Serpent' is *so* last Tuesday. You need a name that screams 'pirate' but whispers 'comedy genius.' Prepare for names so ridiculous, even Blackbeard would chuckle!",
  "howToUse": [
    "Click the 'Generate' button. (Duh!)",
    "Read the ridiculously funny pirate ship name that appears.",
    "Laugh until your sides hurt (optional, but highly encouraged).",
    "If you're not feeling it, click 'Generate' again! We've got more silly names than Davy Jones has lockers.",
    "Use the name! Sail the seven seas (or your local pond) with pride and a hearty 'Arrr!'"

    {
      "question": "Are these names *actually* funny?",
      "answer": "We think so! Humor is subjective, but we've aimed for maximum silliness. If you don't laugh, you might be a landlubber at heart."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my actual pirate ship?",
      "answer": "If you have an actual pirate ship... congrats! And yes, absolutely. Just don't blame us if the Royal Navy doesn't take you seriously."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will these names attract more parrots?",
      "answer": "We can't guarantee it, but a funny name is certainly more appealing than a boring one. Parrots love a good laugh (probably)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names generated randomly?",
      "answer": "Yes! We use a complex algorithm involving rum, maps, and a rubber chicken to ensure maximum randomness. (Okay, maybe not the rubber chicken...)"
    },
    {
      "question": "I generated a name that's *too* funny. What do I do?",
      "answer": "Embrace it! A name that's too funny is a gift. Share it with the world, and let the laughter spread like wildfire!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest names to add to the generator?",
      "answer": "Arrr, you can! Send your funniest suggestions our way. If they're suitably ridiculous, we might just add them to the mix!"
