      "question": "What if I don't like any of the generated names?",
      "answer": "Keep hitting that 'Generate' button! The wasteland is vast and full of possibilities. Eventually, you'll find a name that resonates with your inner survivor. If all else fails, try combining elements from different generated names to create something truly unique!"

    {
      "question": "Are the generated names lore-friendly?",
      "answer": "We've tried to capture the spirit of Fallout, but ultimately, it's up to you to decide if a name fits your personal interpretation of the lore.  Don't be afraid to get creative!"

      "question": "Will this generator help me find love in the wasteland?",
      "answer": "We can't guarantee it, but a cool name certainly couldn't hurt!  Who knows?  Maybe 'Vault-Tec Valerie' is just waiting to meet her 'Radical Rick'."
