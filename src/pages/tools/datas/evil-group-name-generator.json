Something that screams 'We're up to no good!' Our Evil Group Name Generator is here to help you craft the perfect title for your nefarious organization.

    "Don't like the first result? Keep clicking! We've got more evil names than you can shake a stick of dynamite at.",

    {
      "question": "Is this generator actually evil?",
      "answer": "Only in the most delightful, fictional way. We're not responsible for any actual acts of villainy inspired by our names."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my band?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Evil band names are the best band names. Just don't blame us when you accidentally summon a demon on stage."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the generated names copyrighted?",
      "answer": "Nope! Feel free to use them as you wish. Though, if someone else comes up with the same name independently, that's just cosmic coincidence (or, you know, convergent evil thinking)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I need a name that's *really* evil?",
      "answer": "Keep generating! Or, get creative and mix and match prefixes and suffixes to create your own unique brand of wickedness."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will using one of these names make me a better villain?",
      "answer": "A great name is a good start. The rest is up to you! Sharpen your evil laugh, perfect your monologues, and remember to always have a backup plan."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes or suffixes?",
      "answer": "We're always looking for ways to make our generator even more evil! Send your suggestions our way. We'll consider them... menacingly."
