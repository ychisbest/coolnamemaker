      "question": "What exactly *is* a Duergar?",
      "answer": "Duergar, also known as gray dwarves, are a subterranean race of dwarves known for their dour personalities, psionic abilities, and skill in crafting. Think dwarves, but with a serious case of the grumps and a penchant for mind games."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are these names suitable for both male and female Duergar?",
      "answer": "While some names might lean towards a specific gender, most are designed to be fairly gender-neutral. Feel free to adapt them to fit your character!"

      "answer": "Absolutely! That's what they're here for! Go forth and role-play with the might of a mountain!"

    {
      "question": "Are the names generated completely random?",
      "answer": "They're based on patterns and sounds inspired by existing Duergar names and dwarven lore, but the combinations are randomized. So, yes, they're *mostly* random, with a touch of dwarven magic."
    },
    {
      "question": "I generated a name that sounds a bit\u2026 silly. What gives?",
      "answer": "Hey, even Duergar have a sense of humor (a dark, twisted one, perhaps). If you don't like a name, just generate another! The Underdark is vast, and so are the possibilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes or suffixes to be added?",
      "answer": "We're always looking for ways to improve the forge! Feel free to send your suggestions our way. Maybe your contribution will become a legend in the annals of Duergar naming!"
