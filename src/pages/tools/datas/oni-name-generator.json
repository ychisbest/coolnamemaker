    {
      "question": "What exactly *is* an Oni?",
      "answer": "Oni are fearsome demons or ogres from Japanese folklore. They're often depicted with horns, sharp claws, and a penchant for causing trouble. Think of them as the rock stars of the underworld."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are these names *real* Oni names?",
      "answer": "While we draw inspiration from Japanese mythology and language, these names are creatively crafted for maximum coolness and impact. They're more 'inspired by' than 'authentic,' so feel free to embrace the artistic license!"
