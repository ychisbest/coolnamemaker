      "question": "Are these names actually good?",
      "answer": "Good? They're legendary! We've consulted with the ghost of Blackbeard himself to ensure maximum pirate awesomeness."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my novel/game/LARP?",
      "answer": "Aye, feel free to use them as you please! Just remember where you got 'em when you're accepting your Pulitzer/Game Award/Golden Doubloon."

      "question": "Will using one of these names guarantee me success as a pirate?",
      "answer": "While we can't guarantee you'll find buried treasure or become the terror of the seas, a great name is definitely a good start. The rest is up to your swashbuckling skills!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names generated random?",
      "answer": "Mostly! We use a complex algorithm (and a touch of pirate magic) to combine prefixes and suffixes in ways that are both fearsome and unique."

    {
      "question": "I got a really silly name. Is that supposed to happen?",
      "answer": "Sometimes! Even pirates have a sense of humor. If you get a name that's more 'giggle' than 'grog,' just hit 'Generate' again. There are plenty more where that came from!"

    {
      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes or suffixes for the generator?",
      "answer": "Arrr, of course! We're always looking to expand our pirate vocabulary. Send your suggestions to our crow's nest (aka our contact form)."
