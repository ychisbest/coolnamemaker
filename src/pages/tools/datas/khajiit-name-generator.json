      "question": "What exactly *is* a Khajiit?",
      "answer": "Ah, a curious one! Khajiit are a feline race from the province of Elsweyr, known for their intelligence, agility, and... fondness for moon sugar. They come in many forms, from the housecat-like Alfiq to the towering Senche-raht."

      "answer": "We've delved deep into the lore of Tamriel to bring you names that feel authentic and true to the Khajiit spirit. While we can't guarantee 100% accuracy (because, magic!), we've done our best to capture the essence of Khajiit naming conventions."

    {
      "question": "Why do Khajiit talk in the third person?",
      "answer": "It's a cultural quirk, my friend! Some scholars believe it's a way for Khajiit to emphasize their individuality, while others think it's just... how they talk. Either way, it adds to their charm, doesn't it?"
    },
    {
      "question": "Help! I can't choose a name. They're all so good!",
      "answer": "A common Khajiit problem! Take your time, let the names sink in, and perhaps even roll a die to decide. Or, you know, just pick the one that sounds the coolest. Your Khajiit character will thank you."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are all Khajiit thieves?",
      "answer": "Absolutely not! That's a nasty stereotype! While some Khajiit may have a knack for acquiring things (let's call it 'resourcefulness'), they're a diverse people with all sorts of skills and professions. Don't judge a cat by its claws!"
