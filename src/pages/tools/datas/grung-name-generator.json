    {
      "question": "What exactly is 'grung'?",
      "answer": "Ah, a valid question! 'Grung' is a deliberate misspelling of 'grunge,' adding a touch of irreverence and uniqueness. It's our little way of paying homage to the genre's rebellious spirit."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this generator make me instantly cool?",
      "answer": "While we can't guarantee instant coolness (that requires genuine attitude and a questionable fashion sense), we can certainly provide you with a name that *sounds* cool. The rest is up to you, my friend."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my band?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! That's what it's here for! Just remember to check if the name is already taken before you start printing those band posters."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names generated completely random?",
      "answer": "They're *mostly* random, but we've carefully curated the prefixes and suffixes to ensure they evoke the gritty, raw, and slightly depressing atmosphere of the grunge era. Think flannel shirts, ripped jeans, and existential dread... in name form."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like any of the generated names?",
      "answer": "Keep clicking! The beauty of randomness is that eventually, you'll find a name that speaks to your soul (or at least doesn't make you cringe too hard). And hey, if all else fails, you can always combine elements from different names to create your own masterpiece."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this generator safe to use? Will it steal my data?",
      "answer": "Totally safe! We're just here to help you find a cool name, not steal your identity. We don't collect any personal information, so you can generate names to your heart's content without worrying about Big Brother (or Big Grunge) watching."
