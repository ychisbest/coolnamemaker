    {
      "question": "Are these names actually good?",
      "answer": "Good is subjective, my friend. But are they *interesting*? Absolutely. We aim for names that spark conversation, inspire loyalty, and maybe even confuse a few people. Isn't that what a good fraternity name should do?"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for something other than a fraternity?",
      "answer": "Technically, yes. But would you *want* to use 'Sigma Omega Chaos' for your cat? Probably not. But hey, it's your call. We're not the boss of you (unless you're pledging to *our* fraternity)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will these names get me kicked off campus?",
      "answer": "We strive for originality and fun, but not at the expense of good taste (mostly). We can't guarantee that your university's administration has the same sense of humor, so use your best judgment. If a name seems too edgy, maybe tone it down a notch. Or don't. Live on the wild side!"
    },
    {
      "question": "How many times can I generate a name?",
      "answer": "Until your finger gets tired of clicking! We have a vast database, so you're unlikely to see repeats anytime soon."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are these names trademarked?",
      "answer": "Nope! All names generated are free for you to use. However, we always recommend doing a quick trademark search to be absolutely sure nobody else has claimed it first. Better safe than sorry!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes or suffixes for the generator?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We love feedback. Send your suggestions our way, and we might just add them to the mix. Help us make this the ultimate fraternity name generator!"
