      "question": "Are these names historically accurate?",
      "answer": "While we've drawn inspiration from historical pirates and nautical terms, most of these names are fictional. They're designed to be fun and evocative, not necessarily historically precise. Think of it as pirate-themed fantasy!"

      "question": "Can I use these names for my book/game/movie?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Consider them a starting point for your own creative endeavors. We only ask that you don't directly copy and paste the entire list into a published work."

      "question": "I got a really silly name. Is that supposed to happen?",

    {
      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes or suffixes for the generator?",
      "answer": "Aye, you can! We're always looking for ways to expand our treasure chest of names. Send your suggestions our way, and we'll consider adding them to the generator."
