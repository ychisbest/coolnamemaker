      "question": "Are these names actually from the Harry Potter books?",
      "answer": "While some names might have a familiar ring, most are inspired by the *feeling* of the Harry Potter universe. Think of it as expanding the magical family tree!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my fanfiction?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! That's what they're here for! Go wild, create compelling characters, and weave your own magical tales."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this generator tell me which Hogwarts house I belong to?",
      "answer": "Sadly, no. This generator only deals with last names. For house sorting, you'll need a Sorting Hat (or a good online quiz)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this generator affiliated with J.K. Rowling or Warner Bros.?",
      "answer": "Nope! We're just a bunch of Potterheads having fun and sharing the magic. We're not officially endorsed, but we're definitely fans!"
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I get a really silly sounding name?",
      "answer": "Embrace the silliness! Not every wizard can be a serious Dark Arts fighter. Maybe you're destined to be the next Gilderoy Lockhart... or just have a really memorable Quidditch commentary."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use the same last name as a canon character?",
      "answer": "Of course! But just be aware that your character might be mistaken for a relative or descendant of that famous wizard. Unless that's what you want, then go for it!"
