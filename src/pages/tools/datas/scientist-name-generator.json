      "question": "Is this generator actually based on real science?",
      "answer": "Well, sort of. We've sprinkled in some genuine scientific terms, but mostly, we're just having fun. Think of it as science-inspired, not scientifically accurate."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my scientific publication?",
      "answer": "We wouldn't recommend it... unless you're going for a truly avant-garde approach. But hey, who are we to judge? Just be prepared for some interesting peer reviews."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like any of the generated names?",
      "answer": "Keep clicking! Or, get creative and use the prefixes and suffixes as inspiration to build your own perfect name. The possibilities are as endless as the universe (or at least, as endless as our list of scientific terms)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are these names suitable for both male and female scientists?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Science knows no gender, and neither do our names. We've designed them to be versatile and inspiring for everyone."

    {
      "question": "Can I suggest new prefixes or suffixes for the generator?",
      "answer": "We'd love to hear your ideas! Send them our way, and we might just add them to our ever-expanding lexicon of scientific silliness. The more, the merrier (and the madder)!"

      "question": "Is it illegal to name my pet hamster 'Professor Quantum Fluffernutter'?",
      "answer": "Probably not, but your hamster might judge you. Use your best judgement (and maybe consult with your hamster's legal counsel)."
