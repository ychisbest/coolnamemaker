      "question": "Is this generator actually going to give me a *good* frat name?",
      "answer": "Is beer cold? Of course! We've packed this generator with prefixes and suffixes designed to create names that are both memorable and, dare we say, kinda sophisticated. (Okay, maybe not *sophisticated*, but definitely cool.)"

      "question": "Can I use these names for other things besides fraternities?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Use them for your D&D group, your fantasy football team, your competitive hot dog eating squad \u2013 the possibilities are endless! We won't judge... much."

      "question": "Are these names trademarked? I don't want to get sued!",
      "answer": "Nope! All names generated are completely original and free for you to use. However, we highly recommend checking for existing trademarks before you print it on a banner the size of a small car."

    {
      "question": "Can I suggest a prefix or suffix to be added?",
      "answer": "You bet! We're always looking for ways to make our generator even better. Send us your suggestions and we'll see if they're frat-name-worthy."
