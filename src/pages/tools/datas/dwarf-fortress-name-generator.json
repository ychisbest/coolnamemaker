    "Click the 'Generate' button. It's practically begging to be clicked.",

    "If you're not feeling it, click it again! Dwarven names are like rock: abundant and varied.",
    "Copy and paste your new, glorious name into Dwarf Fortress.",
    "Prepare for your dwarf to become a legend (or a cautionary tale).",

    {
      "question": "Is this generator actually dwarven?",
      "answer": "As dwarven as a generator can be! We consulted ancient texts (and a few forum posts) to ensure authenticity. Results may vary. We are not responsible for any resulting goblin invasions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for other games/stories?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! These names are perfect for any fantasy setting that needs a touch of dwarven grit and gravitas. Just don't blame us if your elves start complaining."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this guarantee my dwarves' survival?",
      "answer": "Ha! Absolutely not. This is Dwarf Fortress, after all. But they'll die with *style*."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like the generated names?",
      "answer": "Then you're probably a goblin! Just kidding (maybe). Click 'Generate' again! We have a vast reservoir of dwarven names just waiting to be unleashed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names lore-friendly?",
      "answer": "Mostly! We've tried to capture the *feel* of dwarven names. Think epic, slightly-grumbly, and ready to carve a mountain in half."
    },
    {
      "question": "My dwarf is now a legendary cheese maker named 'Gristlebeard the Stout'. Is this normal?",
      "answer": "Perfectly normal. Embrace the chaos. That's Dwarf Fortress for you."
