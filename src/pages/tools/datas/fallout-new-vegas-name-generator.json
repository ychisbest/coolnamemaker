  "introduction": "So, you're about to brave the irradiated landscape of New Vegas? Excellent choice! But before you face off against Deathclaws, Caesar's Legion, and the mysteries of the Mojave, you need a name that screams 'survivor' (or at least, 'interesting individual'). Our generator mixes the grit, humor, and sheer weirdness of Fallout to give you a name that'll fit right in. No rads guaranteed (name quality may vary based on user input).",
  "howToUse": [
    "First, ponder your character's vibe: Are they a smooth-talking charmer? A ruthless mercenary? Or just someone who really, *really* likes bottle caps?",
    "Then, mash that 'Generate' button like you're trying to win a prize at the Atomic Wrangler! (But, you know, gently. Don't break anything.)",
    "If the first name isn't quite right, keep hitting it! We've got more combinations than there are flavors of Mentats.",
    "Found a name you love? Awesome! Now go forth and conquer (or at least, survive) the Mojave Wasteland. Don't forget to tell everyone where you got your amazing name!"

      "question": "Will this generator give me a lore-accurate name?",
      "answer": "We strive for authenticity! While we can't guarantee absolute lore perfection, we've packed this generator with elements inspired by Fallout: New Vegas's characters, locations, and general vibe. Think of it as 95% accurate, 5% pure wasteland chaos."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for characters in other games or stories?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! While this generator is geared towards Fallout: New Vegas, feel free to adapt these names for any post-apocalyptic or sci-fi setting. We won't tell the Enclave."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the generated names trademarked?",
      "answer": "Nope! These names are generated, unique combinations. You're free to use them as you see fit. Just don't try to copyright 'Courier Six' - that one's taken."
    },
    {
      "question": "I got a really weird name. Is the generator broken?",
      "answer": "Probably not! Fallout is known for its quirky characters and bizarre situations. A weird name might just be perfect for your eccentric wasteland wanderer. Embrace the weirdness!"

      "question": "Will this generator help me win at Caravan?",
      "answer": "Sadly, no. This generator is for names only. You'll have to rely on your own cunning (and a good deck of cards) to dominate at Caravan."
