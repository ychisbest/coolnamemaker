  "introduction": "Alright, lovebirds! So you've found 'the one'. Congrats! Now comes the *really* important part: finding that perfect, ridiculously cute, maybe-slightly-embarrassing ship name. This generator is like your own personal Cupid, armed with a keyboard instead of arrows. Let's find that name that screams 'YOU TWO!'",
  "howToUse": [
    "Hit that 'Generate' button! Boom! Instant ship name magic.",
    "Hate it? No sweat. Just click again! There are, like, a *million* possibilities. (Okay, maybe not a million, but a LOT.)",
    "Feeling creative? Try mixing the names, adding nicknames...get weird with it!",
    "Found 'the one'? (The ship name, I mean...hopefully you already found your person!) Jot that sucker down before you forget!",
    "Now go plaster that ship name *everywhere*. (Okay, maybe not *everywhere*...but you get the idea.)"

      "question": "What if my partner hates the name?",
