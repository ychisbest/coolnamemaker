      "answer": "Absolutely! We believe that every aspiring superhero deserves a fantastic team name, regardless of their budget. Consider it our gift to you, the future protectors of humanity!"

      "question": "Can I use these names for commercial purposes?",
      "answer": "You're welcome to use the generated names for your stories, games, or even real-life superhero teams (if you have one!). However, we can't guarantee that the names are trademark-free, so it's always a good idea to do a quick search before using them for commercial projects."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will the names be cheesy?",
      "answer": "Some might say 'endearingly classic'! We aim for a balance between heroic, powerful, and, yes, occasionally a little bit campy. After all, what's a superhero without a little bit of flair?"

      "question": "Can I suggest new prefixes or suffixes?",
      "answer": "We're always open to suggestions! Feel free to send us your ideas. If they're awesome enough, we might just add them to the generator and credit you as a honorary member of our creative league!"

      "question": "What if I don't like any of the names?",
      "answer": "Keep generating! The beauty of randomness is that you never know what amazing name will pop up next. And remember, you can always tweak a name to make it your own. It's your team, your rules!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names generated truly random?",
      "answer": "Yes! We use a sophisticated (okay, maybe not *that* sophisticated) algorithm to combine prefixes and suffixes in unpredictable ways. It's like a superhero name lottery, but with a much higher chance of winning!"
