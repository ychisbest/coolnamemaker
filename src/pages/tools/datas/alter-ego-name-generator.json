  "howToUse": [
    "Simply click the 'Generate' button. (Duh!)",

      "question": "What if I don't like the names the generator creates?",
      "answer": "No sweat! Just keep hitting the 'Generate' button. We have a vast database of prefixes and suffixes, guaranteeing a unique (and hopefully awesome) name every time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for commercial purposes?",
      "answer": "Technically, yes. But we're not responsible if Marvel or DC comes knocking. Use at your own risk! (But seriously, probably best to use them for fun.)"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this generator truly random?",
      "answer": "As random as we can make it! We use a sophisticated algorithm (aka a bunch of code) to ensure that each name is unique and unpredictable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this generator make me a superhero?",
      "answer": "Sadly, no. But it will give you the perfect name to *feel* like one. The rest is up to you. (Maybe start with some light calisthenics.)"

    {
      "question": "I think I found a bug in the generator! What should I do?",
      "answer": "First, congratulations on being a super sleuth! Second, please contact us with details about the bug. We appreciate your help in making this generator even more awesome!"

      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes or suffixes for the generator?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We're always looking for fresh ideas. Send your suggestions our way, and we might just add them to the mix."
