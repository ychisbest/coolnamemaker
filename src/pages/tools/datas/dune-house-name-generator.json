  "icon": "\ud83c\udfdc\ufe0f",
  "introduction": "Ever dreamt of ruling Arrakis? Or maybe just throwing a really cool Dune-themed party? Either way, you're gonna need a proper House name. Our generator blends the mystical, the majestic, and the just plain weird to give you a name that'll make even the Emperor take notice. Prepare for power, intrigue, and maybe a sandworm or two.",
  "howToUse": [
    "Simply click the 'Generate' button and BAM! A brand new, totally unique Dune House name appears, forged in the fires of Arrakis (or, you know, our servers).",
    "Don't like the first result? Keep clicking! We've got more combinations than there are grains of sand in the desert.",

    {
      "question": "Is this generator actually endorsed by Frank Herbert's estate?",
      "answer": "While we'd love to say 'yes,' the truth is... probably not. But hey, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, right? We're just huge fans trying to spread the Dune love."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these House names for commercial purposes?",
      "answer": "Technically, yes. But we're not responsible if you get sued by a spice baron. Use at your own risk!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this generator help me control the spice?",
      "answer": "Sadly, no. You'll need a whole lot more than a cool name to control the spice. Try befriending a sandworm. Good luck with that."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the generated names truly random?",
      "answer": "As random as we can make them! We've carefully curated prefixes and suffixes to create a vast array of possibilities. No two clicks should be exactly the same (unless the universe is messing with you)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like any of the generated names?",
      "answer": "Then you're clearly not worthy of ruling a Dune House. Just kidding! Keep clicking, or try mixing and matching. Eventually, you'll find a name that resonates with your inner Muad'Dib."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes and suffixes to add to the generator?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We love hearing from our users. Send your suggestions our way! If we like them, we might add them to our generator. Let's make this the best Dune House Name Generator in the known universe!"
