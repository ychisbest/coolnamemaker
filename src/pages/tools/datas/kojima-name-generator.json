  "icon": "\ud83e\udd14",
  "introduction": "Ever wondered what your name would be if Hideo Kojima, the visionary behind Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding, designed it?

Get ready to embrace your inner auteur!",
  "howToUse": [
    "Simply click the 'Generate' button. Don't overthink it! Kojima wouldn't want you to.",
    "Marvel at the awesomeness of your new, Kojima-esque name.",
    "Share your name with the world and ponder its deeper meaning (optional, but highly encouraged).",
    "Repeat until you find the name that resonates with your existential core. Or until you get bored. Whichever comes first."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What makes a name 'Kojima-esque'?",
      "answer": "Think cryptic symbolism, futuristic jargon, and a hint of melancholy. We've analyzed Kojima's games and extracted the essence of his naming conventions. It's all very meta."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use this name for my next video game character?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! In fact, we encourage it. Just promise us you'll include a convoluted plot twist and a philosophical monologue about the nature of war."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this generator make me a game development genius?",
      "answer": "While we can't guarantee genius, we *can* guarantee you'll have a name that sounds incredibly impressive at game development conferences. The rest is up to you."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this generator endorsed by Hideo Kojima himself?",
      "answer": "Not officially, but we like to think he'd be proud. Maybe he'll even use it to name his next character! (Hey, a fan can dream, right?)"
    },
    {
      "question": "I got a name I don't like. What do I do?",
      "answer": "Embrace the absurdity! Even Kojima has his... eccentric moments. Or just click 'Generate' again. No judgment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names generated truly random?",
      "answer": "As random as the human condition allows. We use a complex algorithm that takes into account factors such as philosophical themes, technological buzzwords, and the sheer unpredictability of Kojima's mind."
