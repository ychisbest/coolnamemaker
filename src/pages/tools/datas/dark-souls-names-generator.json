  "introduction": "Welcome, weary traveler, to the Dark Souls Name Generator! In the unforgiving world of Lordran, a name can be your only solace... or your final epitaph. This generator blends the gothic, the tragic, and the downright epic to forge names that resonate with the spirit of Dark Souls. Whether you're a knight, a sorcerer, or just a hollow trying to survive, we've got a name to suit your doomed adventure.",
  "howToUse": [
    "Click that tempting 'Generate' button \u2013 go on, you know you want to!",
    "Behold! A name forged in the fires of Lordran appears. Is it the one? Or will you tempt fate again?",
    "Keep clicking until a name whispers to your soul (or at least doesn't sound utterly ridiculous).",
    "Embrace your new identity, brave the undead hordes, and remember... don't you dare go hollow!"

      "question": "Is this generator actually related to FromSoftware?",
      "answer": "Sadly, no. We're just fans who love the lore and wanted to create something fun. Miyazaki-san probably has more important things to worry about, like designing new ways to kill us."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for other games or stories?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Feel free to unleash these names upon any world that needs a touch of grimdark awesomeness. We won't tell the Abyss Watchers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are some names so... weird?",
      "answer": "Dark Souls is a weird game! We tried to capture that essence, blending the majestic with the bizarre. Embrace the oddity; it's part of the charm (and the madness)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will using one of these names make me better at Dark Souls?",
      "answer": "Highly unlikely. Skill still matters, Ashen One. But hey, at least you'll look cool while dying repeatedly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes or suffixes for the generator?",
      "answer": "We're always open to suggestions! Send them our way, and we might just add them to the forge. Praise the Sun! (and good ideas)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like any of the generated names?",
      "answer": "Then you, my friend, are truly cursed! But seriously, keep generating. Eventually, something will resonate. Or, you know, just come up with your own. The choice is yours... until you die."
