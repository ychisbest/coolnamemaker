      "question": "Is this generator actually going to make me a rockstar?",
      "answer": "While we can't guarantee sold-out arenas and screaming fans, we *can* guarantee you'll have a killer name that's half the battle! The rest is up to you and your musical talent (or lack thereof... hey, image is everything!)."
