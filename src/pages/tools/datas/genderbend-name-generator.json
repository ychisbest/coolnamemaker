      "question": "How accurate is this generator? Will it *really* give me my true opposite-gender name?",
      "answer": "While we can't guarantee it's your *destined* name, our generator uses a sophisticated (okay, maybe just slightly clever) algorithm to suggest names that are commonly associated with the opposite gender. Think of it as a fun starting point for your gender-bending adventure!"

    {
      "question": "The generated name sounds weird. Is it supposed to?",
      "answer": "Sometimes! The goal is to explore the unexpected and create a little bit of fun. If a name sounds odd, try another one or tweak it with the prefixes and suffixes."

    },
    {
      "question": "Are the generated names culturally sensitive?",
      "answer": "We strive to provide a diverse range of names, but cultural nuances can be complex. Always do your research and be mindful when using a name from a culture you're not familiar with."
