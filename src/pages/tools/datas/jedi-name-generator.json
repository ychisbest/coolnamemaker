      "question": "Are these names 'official' Star Wars names?",
      "answer": "While we've drawn inspiration from the Star Wars universe, these names are generated. They're perfect for creative purposes but aren't 'canon' in the official Star Wars lore."

      "question": "How does the generator create the names?",

    {
      "question": "Can I get a Sith name instead?",

      "question": "My generated name is hilarious! Is that intentional?",
