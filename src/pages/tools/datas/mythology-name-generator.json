      "question": "What kind of mythology are these names based on?",
      "answer": "Primarily Greek and Roman, but we've sprinkled in some Norse, Egyptian, and a dash of other ancient cultures for extra flavor. Basically, if it's legendary, it's in here."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for commercial purposes?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Once generated, the name is yours to wield as you see fit. Just don't try to trademark 'Zeus' or something equally obvious."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names actually from mythology, or are they made up?",
      "answer": "A bit of both! We use real mythological elements and combine them in creative ways to produce names that *sound* authentic, even if they're entirely new."

      "question": "Is there a limit to how many names I can generate?",
