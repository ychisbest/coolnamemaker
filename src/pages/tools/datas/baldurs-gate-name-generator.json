      "question": "Will this generator make me a better D&D player?",
      "answer": "Sadly, no. But you'll have a cooler name while you're failing your saving throws. Think of it as +1 to Charisma (roleplaying bonus only)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are these names lore-friendly?",
      "answer": "We've poured over the lore of Baldur's Gate and the Forgotten Realms to make these names feel authentic. That being said, some names are purely for fun. Use your best judgement!"

    {
      "question": "What if I still can't find a name I like?",
      "answer": "Keep trying! The perfect name is out there, waiting to be discovered. Or, you know, just make one up. That's what the gods would want you to do."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this generator powered by magic?",
      "answer": "Let's just say we consulted with a few friendly wizards. And by 'consulted,' we mean 'bribed with pizza'. So, yes, technically, there's magic involved (pizza magic)."
    },

      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes and suffixes?",
      "answer": "Of course! Send us your suggestions, and who knows, your contribution might end up inspiring the next generation of adventurers. We're always looking for fresh ideas to keep the generator spicin'!"
