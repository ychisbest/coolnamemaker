  "howToUse": [
    "Simply click the 'Generate' button and behold! A brand-new hobbit name, fresh from the oven (or should we say, the Shire?).",

    {
      "question": "Are these names actually hobbit-like?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We've studied Tolkien's works and consulted with Gandalf himself (okay, maybe not Gandalf, but we did our research!). These names are designed to evoke the spirit of the Shire."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my book/game/pet hamster?",
      "answer": "Of course! Feel free to use them for any purpose you desire. Just promise us you'll give your hamster extra pats if you name him Bilbo."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this generator free?",
      "answer": "As free as the air in the Shire! Use it to your heart's content. We just ask that you spread the word and maybe offer us a second breakfast in return (figuratively speaking, of course... unless?)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like any of the generated names?",
      "answer": "Keep clicking! With countless combinations, you're bound to find a name that tickles your fancy. And hey, maybe you're just not meant to be a hobbit. Have you considered being an elf? We have a generator for that too!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Will using this generator make me crave second breakfast?",
      "answer": "Warning: May cause an insatiable desire for elevenses, luncheon, afternoon tea, dinner, and supper. Side effects may also include a sudden urge to live in a cozy hole in the ground."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest names for the generator?",
      "answer": "We'd love to hear your ideas! Send them our way. If we use them, we'll name a fictional hobbit after you (or your pet hamster)."
