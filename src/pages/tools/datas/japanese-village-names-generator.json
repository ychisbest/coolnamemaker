  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Are these names actually real Japanese village names?",
      "answer": "While we draw inspiration from real Japanese place names and linguistic patterns, the generated names are often unique combinations. They're designed to *sound* authentic and evocative, rather than being direct copies of existing villages."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for commercial purposes?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Once a name is generated, it's yours to use as you see fit. Feel free to name your game, book, or even your pet hamster after a generated village (though we're not responsible for any hamster-related cultural appropriation!)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How are the names generated?",
      "answer": "Our generator uses a sophisticated algorithm (and a healthy dose of artistic license) to combine Japanese-inspired prefixes and suffixes. We carefully curate these elements to ensure that the resulting names are both beautiful and believable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest new prefixes or suffixes to add to the generator?",
      "answer": "We're always open to suggestions! If you have a brilliant idea for a prefix or suffix that would enhance the generator, feel free to send it our way. We can't promise we'll use every suggestion, but we appreciate your input!"
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like any of the generated names?",
      "answer": "Keep clicking! Our generator offers a vast array of possibilities. If you're still not satisfied, try adjusting your expectations or exploring other name generators on our site. We're confident you'll find the perfect name eventually!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Will using this generator make me fluent in Japanese?",
      "answer": "Sadly, no. While our generator can provide you with cool-sounding village names, it won't magically bestow you with linguistic superpowers. You'll still need to put in the effort to learn Japanese the old-fashioned way (books, classes, and maybe a few trips to Japan!)."
