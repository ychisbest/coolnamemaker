Whether you're after a pure-blood pedigree or a delightfully quirky identity, get ready to discover your inner Harry, Hermione, or... maybe even a brand new, brilliantly bizarre character!",
  "howToUse": [
    "Simply click the 'Generate' button and BAM! A brand new, magically delicious Harry Potter-esque name appears!",
    "Don't like the first result? Keep clicking! Our generator has more combinations than Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans (hopefully without the earwax flavor).",

    "Share your amazing name with your friends! Let them know you're now officially ready to attend Hogwarts (acceptance letter not included... sorry!)."

    {
      "question": "Are these names actually from Harry Potter?",
      "answer": "Not exactly! We've studied the naming conventions in the Harry Potter universe and created a generator that produces names that *sound* like they belong there. Think of it as fan-fiction-powered nomenclature!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my fan fiction?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! That's what it's for! Go forth and create epic tales with your newly acquired wizarding identity. Just remember to credit us (just kidding... mostly!)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this generator tell me my Hogwarts house?",
      "answer": "Sadly, no. This generator focuses solely on names. For house sorting, you'll need a Sorting Hat (or a good online quiz!)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I get a really weird name?",
      "answer": "Embrace the weirdness! The wizarding world is full of eccentric characters. A unique name just means you're destined for greatness... or at least a memorable side quest."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this generator endorsed by J.K. Rowling?",
      "answer": "Nope! This is a fan-made creation, born out of our love for the Harry Potter universe. We're just having a bit of fun, and we hope you are too!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes or suffixes for the generator?",
      "answer": "We'd love to hear your ideas! Send them our way, and we might just add them to the mix. The more magical options, the better!"
