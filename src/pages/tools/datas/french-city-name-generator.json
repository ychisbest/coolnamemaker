      "question": "Are these names real French cities?",
      "answer": "Some are, some aren't! We've blended real city names with common French prefixes and suffixes to create a mix of authentic and imaginative options. Think of it as 'inspired by' France, rather than a precise geographical guide."

      "question": "Can I use these names for commercial purposes?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Consider these names royalty-free inspiration. Use them for your books, games, businesses \u2013 whatever your heart desires. Just maybe don't blame us if your fictional city gets invaded by fictional Vikings."

    {
      "question": "Why are some of the names so\u2026 unusual?",
      "answer": "We embrace the weird! Sometimes the best names are the ones that stand out. Plus, France has a rich history of quirky place names. We're just keeping that tradition alive."

    {
      "question": "How often is this generator updated?",
      "answer": "We're constantly adding new prefixes, suffixes, and inspirations to keep the generator fresh. Check back often for new possibilities!"

    {
      "question": "I need a name for a *specific* kind of French city (e.g., coastal, mountainous). Can this generator help?",
      "answer": "While the generator doesn't have specific location filters (yet!), you can use the generated names as a starting point. If you get 'Montaigue-sur-Mer', you know it's probably a coastal city. Then, maybe tweak it to 'Belmont-sur-Mer' to suit your tastes. Use your imagination!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there a way to save my favorite names?",
      "answer": "Not directly within the generator, but we recommend copying and pasting your top picks into a document or notes app. That way, you'll have a collection of amazing French city names ready whenever inspiration strikes!"
