  "introduction": "Let's face it, sometimes clean just doesn't cut it. You want a name that's got some grit, some edge, a little bit of *oomph*. Whether you're naming a character in your gritty cyberpunk novel, a back-alley speakeasy, or a metal band that sounds like a garbage disposal fighting a chainsaw, our Dirty Name Generator is here to help you get down and dirty.",
  "howToUse": [
    "Prepare to embrace the chaos! No pristine perfection here.",
    "Smash that 'Generate' button like you're squashing a bug under your heel. Keep going!",
    "Keep generating until a name jumps out and whispers, \"I'm the one, dirtbag.\"",
    "Don't be afraid to mix and match prefixes and suffixes. Get creative! The dirtier, the better.",
    "Once you've found the perfect dirty name, go forth and unleash it upon the world. Just don't blame us if people stare."

    {
      "question": "Is this generator *actually* dirty?",
      "answer": "Think 'dusty road' and 'grimy hands,' not 'R-rated content.' We're aiming for evocative, not offensive."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my business?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Just make sure it aligns with your brand. A 'Rusty Sprocket Bicycle Shop' works. A 'Rusty Sprocket Daycare'\u2026 maybe not."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I find a sophisticated, elegant name here?",
      "answer": "Probably not. This generator is for those who prefer the smell of engine grease to perfume."
    },
    {
      "question": "I generated a name that sounds like a disease. Is that normal?",
      "answer": "Ehhh\u2026 it happens. Keep generating! There are plenty of other delightfully dirty options."

    {
      "question": "Can I contribute prefixes and suffixes?",
      "answer": "We're always open to suggestions! Send 'em our way. The dirtier, the better. (Seriously, though, keep it relatively clean.)"

    {
      "question": "Are these names trademarked?",
      "answer": "We don't check for trademarks. It's your responsibility to ensure the name you choose is available for use."
