      "question": "Is this generator really free?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Our Robot Name Generator is 100% free to use. We just want to spread the robotic love (and maybe collect some data for our own secret robot uprising...just kidding!)."

      "question": "Can I use these names for commercial purposes?",
      "answer": "Go for it! All names generated are yours to use as you see fit. Just don't forget to credit us when your robot empire takes over the world."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will the names always be random?",
      "answer": "Pretty much! We use a sophisticated (and slightly chaotic) algorithm to ensure that each name is fresh and unexpected. You might occasionally see a repeat, but that's just the robots trying to communicate."

    {
      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes or suffixes for the generator?",
      "answer": "We'd love to hear your ideas! Send us your suggestions, and we might just add them to the generator. Help us build the ultimate robot naming machine!"

    {
      "question": "Are the generated names trademarked?",
      "answer": "We do our best to generate unique names, but we can't guarantee that they aren't already in use. It's always a good idea to do a quick trademark search before using a name for commercial purposes."
