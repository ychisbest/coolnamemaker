  "description": "Unleash the sonic brutality! Our Death Metal Band Name Generator conjures up the most guttural, bone-crushing, and downright evil band names this side of the underworld. Prepare to melt faces!",
  "slug": "death-metal-band-name-generator",
  "icon": "\ud83d\udc80",
  "introduction": "Ready to shred? But your band name sounds like a kitten sneezing? Fear not, metalhead! This generator spews forth names so dark, so brutal, they'll make your eardrums bleed (metaphorically, of course... unless?). Get ready to unleash aural devastation!",
  "howToUse": [
    "Click the 'Generate' button. That's it! No sacrifices required (this time).",
    "Keep clicking until you find a name that makes your soul feel nice and corrupted.",
    "Slightly tweak the generated names to make them your own \u2013 add a 'The' or misspell something for extra kvlt points.",
    "Brace yourself for world domination (or at least a decent gig at the local dive bar)."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is this generator actually evil?",
      "answer": "Probably not... but we can't guarantee it won't summon a minor demon. Use with caution (and maybe a pentagram-shaped coaster)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for other things besides death metal bands?",
      "answer": "Technically, yes. But using 'Gore-Soaked Puppy Farm' for your daycare might raise some eyebrows. We recommend sticking to metal."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like any of the names?",
      "answer": "Click 'Generate' again, you unholy ingrate! The abyss has endless names to offer. Or, you know, come up with your own. But where's the fun in that?"
    },
    {
      "question": "Will using one of these names guarantee me fame and fortune?",
      "answer": "No guarantees, but a killer name is half the battle! The rest is talent, practice, and maybe a little luck (or a pact with the devil)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names copyrighted?",
      "answer": "Nope! They're freshly spawned from the depths of our twisted imaginations. Feel free to use them, abuse them, and spread them like a plague."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest words to add to the generator?",
      "answer": "Hell yes! We're always looking for new ways to corrupt the English language. Send your darkest, most depraved word suggestions our way!"
