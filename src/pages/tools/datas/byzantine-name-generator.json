      "question": "Is this generator historically accurate?",
      "answer": "We've taken some *artistic liberties*. While inspired by Byzantine naming conventions, we've also injected a healthy dose of fun. Think of it as historical fiction for your name."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my D&D character?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! In fact, we encourage it. Imagine the look on your DM's face when you introduce yourself as 'Theophylactus the Terrible, Bane of Bulgars'. Priceless."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the generated names actually *cool*?",
      "answer": "Define 'cool'! If your definition involves words like 'basileus', 'strategos', and 'purple-born', then yes, unequivocally cool. If you're looking for 'Chad' or 'Brittany', you're in the wrong empire."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will using a Byzantine name grant me superpowers?",
      "answer": "We cannot guarantee superpowers. However, increased confidence, a heightened sense of drama, and the ability to pronounce ridiculously long words are highly probable side effects."
    },
    {
      "question": "I don't like the name I got. What should I do?",
      "answer": "Click 'Generate' again! The Byzantine Empire lasted for over a thousand years; surely we can find you a name you like within a few clicks. Don't give up, future emperor!"

    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my pet?",
      "answer": "By all means! Imagine calling your cat 'Justinian' or your dog 'Theodora'. They'll be the most distinguished pets on the block."
