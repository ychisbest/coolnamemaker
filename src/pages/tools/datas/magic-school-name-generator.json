  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for commercial purposes (like a book or game)?",
      "answer": "While we encourage creativity, the generated names are intended for inspiration. We recommend doing a thorough trademark search before using a generated name commercially to avoid any potential legal issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names generated completely random?",
      "answer": "Yes and no! Our algorithm combines a curated list of prefixes and suffixes related to magic, history, and mythology. The combinations are random, but the elements are carefully chosen to ensure each name has a certain magical flair."
    },
    {
      "question": "I don't like any of the names! What should I do?",
      "answer": "Don't despair! Keep generating! The beauty of magic is its infinite possibilities. If you're still stuck, try brainstorming words or themes that are central to your school's identity and try generating again with those ideas in mind."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes or suffixes for the generator?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We're always looking to expand our magical lexicon. Send your suggestions to our enchanted inbox at suggestions@coolnamemaker.com. If your suggestion is magically approved, we'll add it to the generator!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Will the generator create names that are already in use?",
      "answer": "It's possible, although unlikely. With a vast combination of prefixes and suffixes, the chances of generating an identical name to an existing school are slim. However, we always recommend doing a quick online search to ensure your chosen name is truly unique."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there a limit to how many names I can generate?",
      "answer": "Nope! Generate as many names as your heart desires. Let the magic flow!"
