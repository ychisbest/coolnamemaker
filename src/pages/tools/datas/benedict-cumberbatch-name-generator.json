      "question": "Is this generator actually endorsed by Benedict Cumberbatch?",
      "answer": "While we can't confirm Mr. Cumberbatch's direct involvement (he's a busy man, you know, solving crimes and charming dragons), we can assure you that the names generated are inspired by his unique style and personality. So, think of it as a tribute from afar!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for my pet hamster?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! In fact, we highly encourage it. Imagine the sheer gravitas of introducing 'Sir Reginald Cumberbatch the Third' at the local pet show. You'll be the talk of the town (or at least, the talk of the hamster wheel)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like the name the generator gives me?",
      "answer": "No worries! Just hit that 'Generate' button again! The Cumber-verse is vast and full of possibilities. Keep clicking until you find a name that tickles your fancy."

    {
      "question": "Are these names suitable for professional use?",
      "answer": "That depends on your profession! If you're a spy, a magician, or a professional tea taster, then yes, absolutely! If you're an accountant... maybe proceed with caution. Unless you want to be known as 'Professor Algernon Cumberbatch, CPA'."

    {
      "question": "Will using a Cumberbatch-inspired name automatically make me as talented and charming as Benedict himself?",
      "answer": "While we can't guarantee instant fame and fortune, we can promise that you'll have a name that's infinitely more interesting than 'John Smith'. And who knows, maybe a little bit of Cumber-magic will rub off on you. Stranger things have happened!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I sue you if I use one of these names and it ruins my life?",
      "answer": "Our lawyers have strongly advised us to say no. Use responsibly, and remember to blame yourself for bad decisions."
