    "Keep clicking until you find a name that resonates with your inner pirate (or marine, we don't judge... much).",

    {
      "question": "What kind of names does this generator create?",
      "answer": "We aim for names that feel authentic to the One Piece universe \u2013 a mix of powerful pirate-y vibes, quirky epithets, and maybe a hint of devil fruit influence. Think along the lines of 'Red-Haired Shanks' or 'Cat Burglar Nami'."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use the generated name for my One Piece fanfiction or role-playing game?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! That's what it's here for! Unleash your creativity and let your imagination run wild. Just remember to give credit where credit is due (to the genius that is Oda-sensei, and maybe a small nod to this generator \ud83d\ude09)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the generator truly random?",
      "answer": "As random as Luffy's decisions! We use a carefully crafted algorithm (aka a bunch of lists and some fancy code) to ensure a wide variety of names. But hey, if you get a name you don't like, just hit generate again!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this generator give me a devil fruit power too?",
      "answer": "Sadly, no. You'll have to find your own devil fruit (good luck with that!). But a cool name is a good start, right? Maybe it'll attract the attention of a powerful fruit..."
    },
    {
      "question": "I got a really weird name. Is that normal?",
      "answer": "Totally! One Piece is full of weird and wonderful characters. Embrace the oddity! Maybe that's the key to your true potential. Besides, who wants to be 'Normal McNormalface' when you can be 'Banana Beard Bartholomew'?"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes or suffixes to be added?",
      "answer": "You bet! We're always looking to improve our generator. Send your suggestions our way, and we'll see if we can incorporate them. The more the merrier!"
