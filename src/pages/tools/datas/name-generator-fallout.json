  "introduction": "The bombs have dropped, society has crumbled, and the only thing standing between you and oblivion is a killer name. Ditch the boring 'Survivor 27' and embrace a title that'll make even Deathclaws think twice! Our Fallout Name Generator is your one-stop shop for crafting legendary wasteland identities. Get ready to forge your legend!",
  "howToUse": [
    "Simply click the 'Generate' button. (Yeah, it's that easy. We're not asking you to hack a terminal.)",
    "Behold! A brand new, wasteland-worthy name appears!",
    "Don't like it? Hit 'Generate' again! We've got more names than a Super Mutant has fingers (and that's saying something).",
    "Found the perfect name? Copy it and paste it into your Fallout game or fanfic. Now go forth and conquer the wasteland, champion!"

      "question": "Can I use these names for my Fallout tabletop RPG character?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! These names are perfect for injecting some wasteland flavor into your tabletop adventures. Go wild!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are these names lore-friendly?",
      "answer": "We've done our best to capture the spirit of the Fallout universe. While not all names are directly lifted from the games, they're designed to feel right at home in the wasteland."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest names to be added to the generator?",
      "answer": "We'd love to hear your suggestions! Send them our way through the contact form on the website. We're always looking to expand our wasteland vocabulary."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this generator give me a name that guarantees I'll find rare loot?",
      "answer": "While we can't promise legendary loot drops (sorry!), a cool name is definitely a step in the right direction. Think of it as a charisma boost for your character. But it's not our fault if you get killed by a Super Mutant Behemoth, ok?"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this generator powered by a pre-war AI?",
      "answer": "While we appreciate the compliment, it's just good ol' fashioned coding and a love for all things Fallout. No sentient robots were harmed in the making of this generator... probably."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are some names weirder than others?",
      "answer": "The wasteland is a weird place, and we want our names to reflect that! Some names are meant to be serious, others a bit silly. It's all part of the fun!"
