Our generator combines edgy prefixes and suffixes to create hacker names that are both memorable and mildly intimidating. Get ready to rebrand!",

      "question": "Is this generator actually going to make me a hacker?",
      "answer": "Sadly, no. This generator is purely for entertainment purposes. Actual hacking requires skills, knowledge, and a questionable moral compass. (We're not judging.)"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for illegal activities?",
      "answer": "We strongly advise against it. This generator is meant for fun and games. Using these names for anything illegal is a bad idea and could get you into serious trouble."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the generated names unique?",
      "answer": "While we strive for uniqueness, there's always a chance of duplication. The internet is a big place, after all. If you find a duplicate, consider it a sign that you're destined to be rivals!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest new prefixes and suffixes?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We're always looking for ways to improve our generator. Feel free to send us your suggestions. We'll add them if they're cool enough (and not too offensive)."
    },
    {
      "question": "My generated name sounds ridiculous. Is that normal?",
      "answer": "Perfectly normal! Some of the generated names are intentionally silly. Embrace the absurdity and have fun with it!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Will using a hacker name from this generator protect me online?",
      "answer": "Unfortunately, no. A cool name won't shield you from viruses, phishing scams, or government surveillance. Practice safe browsing habits and use strong passwords!"
