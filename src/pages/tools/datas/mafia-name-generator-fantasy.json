      "question": "Can I use these names for my D&D character?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! While designed for mafia fantasy characters, these names are versatile enough for any role-playing game, novel, or even your pet goblin."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the generated names actually good?",
      "answer": "We think so! We've carefully curated prefixes and suffixes to ensure each name has that perfect blend of menace and magic. But hey, beauty (and terror) is in the eye of the beholder."
