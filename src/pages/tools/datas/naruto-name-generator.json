      "question": "Is this generator officially endorsed by Masashi Kishimoto?",
      "answer": "While we'd love to say yes, the truth is, it's fan-made with lots of love (and a healthy dose of ramen). So, no official endorsement, but plenty of ninja spirit!"

      "question": "Will this generator give me super ninja powers?",
      "answer": "Sadly, no. But a cool name is the first step to feeling like a super ninja, right? You'll have to learn the Chidori on your own, though. We recommend starting with YouTube tutorials (and maybe a good first-aid kit)."
