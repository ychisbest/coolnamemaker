  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is this generator actually endorsed by Akira Toriyama?",
      "answer": "While we'd love to say yes, sadly, no. This is purely fan-made with a whole lotta love (and maybe a little bit of Senzu Bean power)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this generator make me as strong as Piccolo?",
      "answer": "Unfortunately, no. You'll still need to train intensely in hyperbolic time chambers. This generator only provides the NAME part of the equation."

      "answer": "Absolutely! Go wild! We encourage you to unleash your creativity and share your Namekian adventures with the world."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names generated actually meaningful in Namekian?",
      "answer": "While we strive for authenticity, Namekian is a fictional language! These names are designed to *sound* like they belong in the Dragon Ball universe."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I get a name I don't like?",
      "answer": "Keep generating! There are tons of possibilities. And hey, maybe that 'bad' name is actually perfect for a villain. You never know!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes or suffixes for the generator?",
      "answer": "We'd love to hear your ideas! While we can't guarantee we'll add them all, we're always looking for ways to improve the Namekian naming experience. Send your suggestions our way!"
