    {
      "question": "How does this generator create Tolkien names?",
      "answer": "We've studied Tolkien's languages and naming patterns to create an algorithm that blends authentic sounds and structures. It's part linguistic wizardry, part pure imagination!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for commercial purposes?",
      "answer": "While we encourage creativity, remember that Tolkien's works are copyrighted. Use these names for personal projects, fan fiction, and role-playing games. For commercial use, you'll need to do your own legal research."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names generated actually from Tolkien's books?",
      "answer": "Not exactly. They are inspired by and created in the style of Tolkien's names, using similar linguistic patterns and themes. You won't find 'Bob Baggins' here, promise!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get a female/male/neutral name?",
      "answer": "The generator creates a variety of names, some leaning towards traditionally masculine or feminine sounds, and many that are delightfully ambiguous. Keep generating until you find one that resonates with you!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this generator endorsed by the Tolkien Estate?",
      "answer": "Sadly, no. We're just huge fans paying homage to the master of fantasy. This is a fan-made tool, created with love and respect for Tolkien's world."
    },
    {
      "question": "The name generated is weird, what should I do?",
      "answer": "Some names might sound strange or unusual - that's part of the fun of fantasy! If you don't like a generated name, just hit the 'Generate' button again for a new one. Keep trying until you find the perfect fit for your character or story."
