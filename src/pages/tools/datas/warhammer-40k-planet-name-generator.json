Prepare to be inspired, Inquisitor!",
  "howToUse": [
    "Simply click the 'Generate' button. Seems easy enough, right? Even a guardsman could manage it.",
    "Observe the glorious name presented before you. Is it suitably grim? Does it evoke the dread and majesty of the Imperium? If not...",
    "Click 'Generate' again! Keep going until you find the perfect name to strike fear into the hearts of heretics and xenos scum.",

      "question": "Are these names officially sanctioned by Games Workshop?",

    {
      "question": "I generated a name that sounds... a bit silly. Is that normal?",
      "answer": "The Warp is a strange and chaotic place, and sometimes that chaos spills over into name generation. Just hit 'Generate' again \u2013 the God-Emperor provides!"
