      "question": "Is this generator actually related to Game of Thrones or George R.R. Martin?",
      "answer": "While we're huge fans, this is an independent creation. We've drawn inspiration from the world of Westeros, but we're not officially affiliated. Think of it as fan-made with love (and a healthy dose of dragon fire!)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for commercial purposes?",
      "answer": "We provide these names for creative inspiration. Using them commercially is at your own risk. We recommend checking for trademark issues if you plan on using a generated name for a product or business."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the generated names truly unique?",
      "answer": "We strive to create a diverse range of names, but with a finite number of prefixes and suffixes, there's a chance of occasional overlap. However, the combinations are vast, so you're likely to find something truly special."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are some names so weird?",
      "answer": "Dragons are ancient, powerful, and sometimes a little eccentric. We've included some unusual options to capture that spirit. Embrace the weirdness! It's what makes dragons so cool!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Will you be adding more prefixes and suffixes in the future?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We're always looking for ways to improve the generator and provide even more awesome names. Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to suggest your own ideas!"
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like any of the names?",
      "answer": "Keep generating! Or, use the generator as inspiration and tweak the names to your liking. The point is to spark your creativity and help you find the perfect name for your dragon."
