      "question": "Is this generator actually endorsed by George R.R. Martin?",
      "answer": "Sadly, no. While we'd love to claim a direct connection to the master storyteller, this generator is purely fan-made with a whole lot of love for Westeros."

    },
    {
      "question": "Are the generated names actually good?",
      "answer": "We think so! We've poured our hearts (and a few dragon eggs) into crafting prefixes and suffixes that sound appropriately regal, fearsome, and occasionally slightly ridiculous (in a good way, of course). But hey, beauty is in the eye of the beholder... or the ear of the listener?"
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like any of the names?",
      "answer": "Keep generating! With countless combinations, you're bound to stumble upon a name that speaks to your soul (or at least sounds really cool on a banner)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes or suffixes for the generator?",
      "answer": "We'd love to hear your ideas! Send them our way, and we might just add them to the mix. Together, we can build a truly legendary name generator!"
