    {
      "question": "Why do I need a pen name?",
      "answer": "There are tons of reasons! Maybe you want to keep your writing separate from your professional life. Perhaps you're writing in a genre that doesn't quite match your 'real' brand. Or maybe you just want to reinvent yourself! A pen name gives you the freedom to explore different writing styles and personas."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the pen names generated by this tool actually any good?",
      "answer": "We think so! We've carefully curated our prefixes and suffixes to create names that are memorable, intriguing, and just plain cool. But ultimately, the best pen name is one that resonates with you and fits your writing style."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use the same pen name as another author?",
      "answer": "Technically, yes, but it's generally not a good idea. It can lead to confusion, especially if the other author is well-known. Do a quick Google search to make sure your chosen pen name isn't already taken."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like any of the generated names?",
      "answer": "Keep generating! We've got thousands of combinations. You can also try tweaking the prefixes and suffixes to create something completely unique. And if all else fails, use our generator as a starting point and brainstorm your own ideas."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to legally register my pen name?",
      "answer": "In most cases, no. However, if you plan to publish your work through a traditional publisher, they may require you to register your pen name as a trademark. Consult with an attorney for legal advice."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use this generator for other types of names besides pen names?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! While it's designed with writers in mind, you can use it to generate names for characters, bands, businesses, or anything else that needs a catchy moniker. Get creative!"
