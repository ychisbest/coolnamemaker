      "question": "What makes a name 'dystopian'?",
      "answer": "Think gritty, edgy, and evocative of a world in chaos. Names that suggest strength, resilience, or a touch of rebellion are perfect. We aim for names that sound like they belong in a cyberpunk novel or a post-apocalyptic wasteland."
    },

      "question": "Can I use these names for my book/game/band?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! That's what they're here for. Consider them a starting point for your creative journey. Feel free to tweak them to fit your specific vision."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names generated completely random?",
      "answer": "We use a carefully curated list of prefixes and suffixes designed to evoke a dystopian feel. So, while the combinations are random, the overall vibe is decidedly dark and future-y."

    {
      "question": "Will using this generator make me cooler?",

    {
      "question": "Is there a limit to how many names I can generate?",
      "answer": "Nope! Generate to your heart's content. We'll keep churning out names until the robots take over... or until you find the perfect one."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like any of the names?",
      "answer": "Keep hitting that 'Generate' button! We're constantly adding new prefixes and suffixes to keep things fresh and exciting. Or, you know, as exciting as dystopia can be."
