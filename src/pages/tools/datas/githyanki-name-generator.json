    {
      "question": "What exactly *is* a Githyanki?",
      "answer": "Ah, a fair question, earthling! The Githyanki are a race of astral plane-dwelling warriors, known for their psionic abilities, silver swords, and eternal war against the mind flayers. Think space pirates, but with psychic powers and a serious grudge."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are these names 'official' Githyanki names?",
      "answer": "While we strive for authenticity, these names are inspired by established Githyanki naming conventions. They're perfect for tabletop RPGs, creative writing, or just having fun. Consider them 'canon-adjacent'."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for other fantasy races?",
      "answer": "Technically, you *could*. But these names are specifically designed to evoke the Githyanki's unique culture and history. Using them for, say, a halfling might raise some eyebrows. (Unless that halfling has a *really* interesting backstory...)"
