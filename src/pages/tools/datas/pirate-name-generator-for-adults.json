  "description": "Ahoy there, matey! Ready to shiver some timbers and plunder the seven seas? But first, ye need a proper pirate name. This generator will give you a name that'll make even Blackbeard tremble in his boots. (Results may vary if Blackbeard is already trembling from scurvy.)",
  "slug": "adult-pirate-name-generator",
  "icon": "\ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f",
  "introduction": "Forget 'Captain Jack Sparrow' \u2013 those are rookie numbers! We're talkin' names that reek of rum, gunpowder, and questionable hygiene. Get ready to embrace your inner scallywag with a pirate name that's as unique and fearsome as you are. Just don't blame us if parrots start following you around.",
  "howToUse": [
    "Click the 'Generate' button. (Duh!)",
    "Marvel at the awesomeness of your new pirate identity. Seriously, soak it in.",
    "Repeat until you find a name that makes you want to shout 'Arrr!' or at least raise a glass of grog.",
    "Go forth and terrorize the high seas (or at least your local pub). We are not responsible for any resulting mayhem. You've been warned!"

    {
      "question": "Is this generator really only for adults?",
      "answer": "Well, the names are designed to be a bit more\u2026 robust. Let's just say some might involve rum-soaked adventures and the occasional kraken encounter. Parental discretion advised!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use this name for official pirate business?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! As long as your 'official pirate business' involves things like costume parties, role-playing games, or writing incredibly silly fan fiction. We don't endorse actual piracy. Plundering is bad, m'kay?"
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like the name I get?",
      "answer": "Keep hitting that 'Generate' button! The sea is vast, and so is the potential for pirate names. Eventually, you'll find one that fits like a well-worn eye patch."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this generator help me find buried treasure?",
      "answer": "Sadly, no. This generator is purely for entertainment purposes. But hey, a cool pirate name might increase your chances of convincing someone *else* to help you look for treasure!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names historically accurate?",
      "answer": "Loosely. We've taken some liberties for the sake of fun. Think of it as 'historically inspired' rather than a meticulously researched historical document. If you want accuracy, go read a book. If you want a hilarious pirate name, you're in the right place."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest names for the generator?",
      "answer": "Arrr, of course ye can! Send yer suggestions to the depths of our email inbox. We'll consider 'em... after we finish our grog. But seriously, we appreciate the input!"
