      "question": "Are the names generated FDA-approved?",
      "answer": "Absolutely not! Our generator is for creative inspiration only. You'll still need to go through the rigorous FDA approval process. Think of us as your brainstorming buddy, not your regulatory shortcut."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for real medicine?",
      "answer": "You can certainly use them as a starting point! However, always check for trademark conflicts and consult with legal professionals before settling on a final name. We don't want you getting sued by 'CoughAwayinator'!"

      "question": "What if I don't like any of the generated names?",
      "answer": "Keep clicking! Or, try adjusting the prefixes and suffixes. Our goal is to spark your imagination and get you thinking outside the pill bottle."
