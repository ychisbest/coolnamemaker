  "introduction": "So, you're ready to take over the world, huh? Or maybe just invent a self-folding laundry machine? Either way, every evil scientist (or ambitious inventor) needs a name that strikes fear (or at least inspires mild curiosity) in the hearts of their enemies (or potential investors). Our generator will help you find that perfect blend of menacing and memorable!",
  "howToUse": [
    "First, brace yourself for the sheer awesomeness that's about to be unleashed.",
    "Click the 'Generate' button. (Yeah, it's that simple. We're scientists, not magicians... mostly.)",
    "Behold! A name worthy of your diabolical (or incredibly innovative) plans!",
    "Don't like it? Click again! We have more names than you have beakers (and you probably have a lot of beakers).",
    "Once you find *the* name, write it down! Engrave it on your lab coat! Tattoo it on your pet lab rat! (Okay, maybe not the last one...)",
    "Go forth and CONQUER (or, you know, just do some cool science)."

      "question": "Is this generator *actually* evil?",
      "answer": "Only in the most fun and theatrical way possible! We promise no actual world domination plots were used in its creation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for characters in my book/game/comic?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We'd be honored! Just promise to name a lab rat after us (hypothetically, of course)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't *feel* particularly evil?",
      "answer": "That's okay! You can still use it to generate quirky and unique names for any character or project. Think of it as 'eccentric genius' instead of 'evil scientist'."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names generated truly random?",
      "answer": "As random as our algorithms allow! We've mixed in a healthy dose of science, a pinch of madness, and a whole lot of creative license."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will using this generator make me a *real* evil scientist?",
      "answer": "Only if you let it! We're just providing the tools. What you do with them is up to you... *evil laugh*... just kidding! (Mostly.)"
    },
    {
      "question": "I generated a name that's already taken! What do I do?",
      "answer": "Bummer! But hey, that just means you have excellent taste. Try generating a few more until you find one that's uniquely yours."
