  "introduction": "Ever dreamt of being a Saiyan warrior, a Namekian strategist, or maybe even a powerful Android? Our DBZ Name Generator is here to make those dreams a reality! We've combined iconic DBZ elements with a dash of creativity to forge epic names worthy of the Dragon Balls themselves. Prepare for transformation!",
  "howToUse": [
    "First, brace yourself for the sheer awesomeness that's about to be unleashed!",
    "Click the 'Generate' button. (It's the one that looks like it's about to go Super Saiyan.)",
    "Behold! Your new DBZ name appears, ready to conquer galaxies and defeat Frieza. (Results may vary; Frieza might just be annoying.)",
    "Not feeling it? Hit 'Generate' again! We've got more combinations than there are Dragon Balls scattered across the universe.",
    "Copy your chosen name and use it to dominate your favorite games, write fanfics that'll make Akira Toriyama proud, or just impress your friends. (Warning: May cause excessive power levels and spontaneous yelling of 'Kamehameha!')"

    {
      "question": "Is this generator actually endorsed by Akira Toriyama?",
      "answer": "While we'd love to say yes (and have him over for tea), the answer is no. This is a fan-made creation fueled by pure, unadulterated DBZ love. We're just huge fans!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use these names for commercial purposes?",
      "answer": "The names generated are for fun and personal use. Using them for commercial projects might get you a visit from Capsule Corp's legal team. (Just kidding... mostly.)"
    },
    {
      "question": "Will these names grant me actual Super Saiyan powers?",
      "answer": "We wish! Sadly, no. But you *will* feel incredibly cool, and that's almost as good, right? (Disclaimer: We are not responsible for any attempts to go Super Saiyan in real life.)"
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't like the name I get?",
      "answer": "No problem! Just keep hitting 'Generate' until you find a name that resonates with your inner warrior. We've got tons of combinations!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names based on existing DBZ characters?",
      "answer": "Some elements are inspired by existing characters, but most of the names are completely original creations designed to capture the essence of the Dragon Ball universe."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I suggest new prefixes or suffixes for the generator?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We're always looking for ways to improve. Send your suggestions our way, and we'll see if we can incorporate them. The more the merrier!"
