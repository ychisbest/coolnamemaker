      "question": "Can I use these names for my published manga?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! While we can't guarantee originality (because, let's face it, inspiration is everywhere!), feel free to use the generated names as a starting point. We encourage you to tweak and customize them to make them truly your own."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the names Japanese?",
      "answer": "The names are inspired by Japanese naming conventions and aesthetics, but they're not necessarily all authentic Japanese names. We aim for that 'manga vibe' rather than strict accuracy."

    {
      "question": "Will this generator help me write my manga too?",
      "answer": "While we can't write your manga for you (we're name generators, not storytellers!), a great name can be a powerful source of inspiration. Let the name guide you!"

    {
      "question": "Can I suggest new prefixes and suffixes?",

    {
      "question": "What if I find a name I love, but someone else is already using it?",
      "answer": "That's a bummer! While we can't police the internet, we recommend doing a quick search to make sure your chosen name isn't already super popular. If it is, consider tweaking it slightly or choosing a different name altogether. Originality is key!"
