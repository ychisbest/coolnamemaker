      "question": "What kind of names does this generator create?",
      "answer": "Think gothic, Victorian, and a little bit... *unhinged*. We're talking names that sound like they were whispered from the Great Ones themselves. Expect a blend of historical influences and Lovecraftian horror."

      "question": "Can I use these names for my Bloodborne character?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! That's what they're for! Go forth and conquer Yharnam with a name that reflects your Hunter's skills and sanity (or lack thereof)."

      "answer": "Completely and utterly free! Use it as many times as you like. Just remember to thank the Great Ones for their generosity... or maybe don't. You never know what they're listening to."
