      "question": "Are these names *actually* apocalyptic?",
      "answer": "As apocalyptic as we can make them without causing actual existential dread. We aim for 'gritty and cool,' not 'therapy-inducing.'"

      "question": "Will using an apocalyptic name actually help me survive the end of the world?",

      "question": "Can I suggest prefixes or suffixes to be added?",
      "answer": "We'd love to hear your ideas! Send them our way \u2013 the more creatively bleak, the better."
