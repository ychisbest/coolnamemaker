  "introduction": "Prepare to be assimilated! This generator crafts designations that'll have you fitting right in with the Borg Collective. Whether you're looking for a cool username, a unique character name, or just want to sound like a cybernetic organism, we've got you covered. Embrace the logic, shed your individuality, and generate your Borg designation now!",
  "howToUse": [
    "Click the 'Generate' button. Like, duh.",
    "Behold your new Borg designation! (Try not to let it go to your head).",
    "If you're not feeling it, hit 'Generate' again. We have endless combinations, just like the Collective.",

      "question": "What exactly *is* a Borg designation?",
      "answer": "It's the name the Borg Collective assigns to its drones. Think of it as your official serial number... but cooler."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will using this generator actually assimilate me into the Borg Collective?",
      "answer": "Probably not. But we take no responsibility if a cube suddenly appears in your backyard."

    {
      "question": "Can I use this for my Star Trek fan fiction?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! In fact, we encourage it. Just be sure to give us a shout-out in the credits!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the generated names actually random?",
      "answer": "As random as our algorithms allow! We've blended logical prefixes and suffixes to create a truly unique (yet Borg-like) naming system."
    },
    {
      "question": "I don't like my Borg designation! What do I do?",
      "answer": "Generate another one! Keep going until you find one that resonates with your inner drone. Or, you know, just resist. We're not *actually* forcing you."

    {
      "question": "Help! I think I'm starting to crave cybernetic implants!",
      "answer": "That's... concerning. Maybe step away from the generator and watch a nice, relaxing episode of Deep Space Nine."
