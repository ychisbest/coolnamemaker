      "question": "Can I use these names for commercial purposes?",
      "answer": "These names are generated, so usage is generally fine. However, always double-check for existing trademarks to be 100% sure. We're here to inspire, not incite legal battles!"

    {
      "question": "Are the names actually cool?",
      "answer": "We like to think so! We've carefully curated our word lists to produce names that sound powerful and memorable. But hey, 'cool' is subjective. If you don't find a name you love right away, keep generating!"

    {
      "question": "Will the generator create real names of existing fighters?",
      "answer": "It's possible, but highly unlikely. Our generator uses a combination of prefixes and suffixes. If a generated name happens to match a real person's, it's purely coincidental."
