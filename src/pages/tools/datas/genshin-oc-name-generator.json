      "question": "Are these names actually used in Genshin Impact?",

      "question": "How does the generator actually work?",
      "answer": "Magic! Just kidding (sort of). We use a carefully curated list of prefixes and suffixes inspired by Genshin's naming conventions and combine them in interesting ways. It's a little bit of algorithm, a little bit of linguistic artistry."
