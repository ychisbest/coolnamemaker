      "question": "What exactly *is* a Juggalo?",
      "answer": "Juggalos are fans of the Insane Clown Posse (ICP) and other Psychopathic Records artists.  More than just music fans, they're a tight-knit community that embraces individuality, loyalty, and a healthy dose of the absurd."

    {
      "question": "Are these names *actually* Juggalo names?",
      "answer": "Well, we can't guarantee ICP will start calling you by your generated name (though, wouldn't that be awesome?). But we've crafted these names to capture the spirit and flavor of Juggalo culture. They're fun, unique, and definitely stand out from the crowd!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use this name for real?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why Faygo?",
      "answer": "Faygo is the official soft drink of Juggalos! ICP started spraying it on the audience during shows, and it's become a beloved tradition.  Plus, it's delicious and comes in a ton of crazy flavors."
