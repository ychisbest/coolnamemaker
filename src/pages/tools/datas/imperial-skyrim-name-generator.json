      "question": "Are these names lore-friendly?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We've delved deep into the lore of Skyrim to ensure our prefixes and suffixes are authentic and fit the world. You won't find any 'xXx_DragonSlayer69_xXx' names here."

      "question": "Is this generator compatible with Khajiit?",
      "answer": "While primarily designed for Imperials and Nords, some generated names might work for Khajiit too! But for truly authentic Khajiit names, you might want to seek out a generator specifically tailored to their naming conventions, yes?"

      "question": "Can I use these names for other fantasy settings?",
      "answer": "While crafted with Skyrim in mind, many names have a general fantasy feel and could work in other worlds. Feel free to experiment and adapt them to your needs!"
